title: Dennett vs. the Cartesian Theatre
last_updated: August 25, 2015

summary: "I review three empirical features of consciousness offered by
Dennett to reject any vestige of the Cartesian Theatre: spatio-temporal
ambiguity; susceptibility to future revision; and that the brain prefers
&lsquo;finding out&rsquo; to &lsquo;filling in&rsquo;. While these are
all important facts about consciousness, none of them count as evidence
against a functional counterpart of the Cartesian Theatre. On the
contrary, they reveal the clever implementation tricks required to
implement precisely such an abstraction."
