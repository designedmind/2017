REPRESENTING OURSELVES

Consciousness is often held to be so mysterious that a theory of it will
require a new kind of science, perhaps one which posits consciousness as an
all-pervasive feature of the universe. We may have to content ourselves with
identifying consciousness with some kind of general-purpose information
processing or informational complexity, with no real insight into why such an
identification makes sense, or accept consciousness as an emergent
epiphenomenon, something that comes along for the ride whenever information is
processed in complex ways. These relegate consciousness to a passive role,
with little to do except come along for the ride.

This is a powerful intuition, but neglects the distinct role that
consciousness plays in our behaviour. Human beings have a rich set of
consciousness-related capabilities: they can describe the world from a vantage
point, contrast how things seem from that vantage point with how they believe
the world to be, summarise their goals and plans, explain the world around
them in terms of possibilities for action, and justify the actions they take
in terms of consciously held beliefs, desires and feelings. Rather than
arising as a mysterious side-effect of information processing, such
&ldquo;consciousness-talk&rdquo; &mdash; elaborate behaviour oriented around
an ostensibly private mental life &mdash; is driven by specific psychological
mechanisms. While we intuit strongly that these behaviours could somehow
happen without &ldquo;real&rdquo; consciousness inside, we remain curiously
oblivious to the fact that if &ldquo;consciousness talk&rdquo; is ever to be
about &ldquo;actual consciousness&rdquo; then it can only be that the latter
is a functional mechanism taking place in the physical world.

It is therefore these behaviours that are the proper target, or explanandum,
of a science of consciousness. Modern theories along these lines, developed by
Daniel Dennett and others, propose that we understand our conscious lives as
the _content_ of an internal self-model. What we intuit as a &ldquo;private
realm&rdquo; is a control mechanism operating in the public world: a brain's
way of representing the organism as an embodied agent, a reflective
self-representation designed by evolution to enable new levels of autonomy,
self-monitoring and deliberative action. By representing not only the world
and its affordances for action, but also ourselves as embodied agents in the
world, and ultimately ourselves as _representers_, the evolving brain
converged on the _self_ as the solution to a control problem. We cannot easily
appreciate the world-model as a model, because &ldquo;we&rdquo; only exist in
virtue of the model, as its central feature.

The symposium is a forum to elaborate, discuss and critique this emerging
scientific picture of consciousness as a form of reflective behaviour. We
invite perspectives from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and informatics.
