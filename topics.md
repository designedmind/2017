THEMES AND TOPICS

The following list of topics is not meant to constrain, but merely to
highlight areas where we feel there are important issues or opportunities to
make progress:

* **Confronting the &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; intuition.** The further-fact
  intuition is so compelling that it is often held to be self-evident. It
  underlies not only David Chalmer's Hard Problem, but also the plausibility
  of philosophical zombies and inverted spectra. Yet according to the
  functionalist view, it is false. A challenge for the functionalist story
  then is to explain _why_ it seems so obvious that consciousness is something
  non-functional, if it is precisely the opposite.
 
* **Brain homologies and animal consciousness.** Brain structures implicated
  in consciousness in humans evolved tens of millions of years ago. Many
  neuroscientists have argued that we will find (primitives forms of)
  consciousness wherever we find homologous structures. These claims seem to
  be in tension with accounts that associate consciousness with specific forms
  of autonomy and behavioural flexibility. Are these homology arguments too
  quick to ascribe consciousness?

* **Role of language.** If homology arguments can seem overly liberal,
  behavioural accounts risk being overly conservative, in linking
  consciousness to self-reports and inevitably to language. Nevertheless, in
  the animal kingdom, the human behavioural phenotype is uniquely flexible.
  What evidence is there relating the evolution of consciousness to the
  evolution of language and to this enhanced flexibility? Michael Arbib for
  example has argued that consciousness evolved in part to explicitly
  represent and communicate pr√©cis of intended behaviour.

* **Consciousness and free will.** According to Daniel Dennett, consciousness
  situates a virtual agent at the centre of a world of behavioural
  possibilities which can be assessed and compared with explicitly considered
  goals. This suggests a deep connection to free will: by allowing an agent to
  act _deliberatively_, consciousness enables _deliberate_ action, action that
  is imagined and evaluated before it takes place and assessed and
  re-evaluated after it has taken place. Is it possible to be conscious and
  not free in this sense? What are the implications for animal consciousness?

* **Consciousness as meta-representation.** A recurring theme in the emerging
  scientific picture is that consciousness is a form of reflective modelling
  of our own capabilities. For example Michael Graziano proposes that as well
  as attending, the brain represents its own attention. Other propose that
  qualia are to be understood as perceptual meta-representations. Again, are
  there implications for animal consciousness? What evidence is there that
  some animals can represent their own attention, or their own percepts?

* **Cartesian functionalism.** Dennett has been an outspoken critic of
  &ldquo;Cartesian materialism&rdquo;, the idea that everything &ldquo;comes
  together&rdquo; for consciousness in some kind of internal re-presentation.
  A key question for functionalism is deciding which parts of the Cartesian
  image are to to be discarded and which retained as valid components of a
  plausible folk theory or mature neuroscience of consciousness.

* **Conscious machines.** A mechanistic theory of consciousness is, by
  definition, something which can be implemented. This raises the prospect of
  testing theories of consciousness through implementation. Conversely, what
  can theories of consciousness tell us about how to implement conscious
  machines?
