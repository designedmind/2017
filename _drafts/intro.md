# The Virtual Cartesian Theatre

Everyday intuition cleaves the natural world into two realms: the
material and the mental. The material realm is where all the stuff
observable to science happens. In the material world we find

The realm of _conscious minds_ seems an inherently distinct domain. For
example, to most people it seems quite plausible that if one could build
a robot which behaved in every way like a person, it would be possible
for that robot to lack an "inner life". (This is sometimes called the
_zombie hypothesis_.) A related intution is that however much we
understand about the mechanics or workings of the brain, it seems to be
a mysterious additional fact that we also have "inner lives". Moreover
facts about our inner lives seem to be _private_ in a way that facts
about the material world are not. I can tell you what it is like to be
me, but there is no shared part of the world I can point to say "that is
what it is like to be me".

This gap between this everyday intuition (the "folk image") and the
scientific image is a large one. The gap between the folk image and the
scientific image remains large, to some, unsurmountably so. It has lead
some philosophers, notably David Chalmers, to argue that the scientific
world-view needs to be extended to include consciousness as a new
primitive. Others, such as Daniel Dennett, have argued that some aspects
of the folk image -- in particular qualia, and the sense that our
consciousness phenomenonology is "plenum", a rich sensory world-image
something like a movie in the brain -- are confused or illusory.

How can we resolve this stand-off?

I have a tentative answer to this question. I believe consciousness can
be understood as a _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_, a mechanism designed by
evolution that embues us, and perhaps some animals, with a specific kind
of reflective behaviour. Unlike Descartes' theatre of the mind, the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre is implemented solely in matter. A Virtual
Cartesian Theatre can be implemented in any computational medium
(although no-one is saying it will be easy). Ours was designed by
evolutionary processes and implemented in biochemistry. A key function
of the mechanism is to generate an elaborate form of
"point-of-view"-oriented behaviour that we call consciousness.

What seems wrong with what I just wrote is that a theory of
consciousness which treats conscious merely as behaviour _must_ leave
something out, almost by definition. The _essence_ of consciousness --
the interesting bit -- isn't just that we _behave_ in interesting ways.
It is the feeling of being "inside our own minds", like we're looking
out at the world through our senses, occupying a unique locus in time
and space, perhaps even watching a "movie in the brain" [Damasio].

Profoundly compelling though it is, I believe this intuition -- that
there is more to consciousness than behaviour -- is also profoundly
wrong. The sense that we are inside our own minds, looking out, perhaps
"observers" of our own consciousness, _is itself nothing more than a
complex feature of our behaviour_. This is by far the hardest part of
the story to understand, and a significant portion of this website will
be devoted to trying to explain it. What I just said seems _obviously
false_. And yet, with some effort, it seems to be possible to understand
consciousness in this way.

The _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_ builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. Whereas Dennett explicitly rejects the language of
qualia and "movies in the brain" as vestiges of Cartesian Dualism, the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre _recasts_ them as robust features of our
behaviour, fitting them, ironically maybe, into a fully Dennettian
world-view. Dennett's approach, according to some critics, "explains
away" consciousness, disregarding most of our non-materialism
intuitions. I believe a complete scientific theory of consciousness
requires construing our non-materialist intuitions as _features of_
consciousness, part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than
lingering confusion about it.

The paragraphs above are little more than a sketch, full of outlandish
claims and impressionistic language. This document is my attempt to
unpack them into something much more comprehensive.
