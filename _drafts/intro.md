# The Virtual Cartesian Theatre

What on Earth is the conscious mind? Whatever the scientific image may
tell us, our everday folk intuitions cleave the natural world into two
realms that are fundamentally distinct yet seem to coexist and interact
in interesting ways.

There is the realm of _matter_, _fundamental forces_, _quantum stuff_,
and whatnot. And there is the realm of _conscious minds_. As scientists
we may believe it is matter doing the thinking. But as _people_ we find
it hard to comprehend that there may be nothing more to us than matter.

[Dennett vs. Chalmers] "Explained away" vs. brand-new theory

I have a tentative answer to this question. I believe consciousness can
be understood as a _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_, a mechanism designed by
evolution that embues us, and perhaps some animals, with a specific kind
of reflective behaviour. Unlike Descartes' theatre of the mind, the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre is implemented solely in matter. A Virtual
Cartesian Theatre can be implemented in any computational medium
(although no-one is saying it will be easy). Ours was designed by
evolutionary processes and implemented in biochemistry. A key function
of the mechanism is to generate an elaborate form of
"point-of-view"-oriented behaviour that we call consciousness.

Your suspension of disbelief probably just broke. A theory of
consciousness which treats conscious merely as behaviour _must_ leave
something out, almost by definition. The _essence_ of consciousness --
the interesting bit -- isn't just that we _behave_ in interesting ways.
It is the feeling of being "inside our own minds", like we're looking
out at the world through our senses, occupying a unique locus in time
and space, perhaps even watching a "movie in the brain" [Damasio].

Profoundly compelling though it is, I believe this intuition -- that
there is more to consciousness than behaviour -- is also profoundly
wrong. The sense that we are inside our own minds, looking out, perhaps
"observers" of our own consciousness, _is itself nothing more than a
complex feature of our behaviour_. This is by far the hardest part of
the story to understand, and a significant portion of this website will
be devoted to trying to explain it. What I just said seems _obviously
false_. And yet, with some effort, it seems to be possible to understand
consciousness in this way.

The _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_ builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. Whereas Dennett explicitly rejects the language of
qualia and "movies in the brain" as vestiges of Cartesian Dualism, the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre _recasts_ them as robust features of our
behaviour, fitting them, ironically maybe, into a fully Dennettian
world-view. Dennett's approach, according to some critics, "explains
away" consciousness, disregarding most of our non-materialism
intuitions. I believe a complete scientific theory of consciousness
requires construing our non-materialist intuitions as _features of_
consciousness, part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than
lingering confusion about it.

The paragraphs above are little more than a sketch, full of outlandish
claims and impressionistic language. This document is my attempt to
unpack them into something much more comprehensive.

# Big questions

## Take-home messages

These are the main claims I will be expanding on the next few years:

* Consciousness is _designed functionality_, like a heart is a designed
  to work as a pump. (The designer here is of course natural selection,
  not an intelligent designer.) The word "designed" emphasises that
  consciousness serves a _function_, rather than being a spurious
  side-effect of having a certain kind of brain, or exhibiting a certain
  kind of behaviour. To put it another way, consciousness _is_ a certain
  kind of behaviour.
* One of the key functions of consciousness is to allow an evolved agent
  to treat its own _perceptual judgements_ -- judgements which are not
  themselves conscious -- as data. For example while any perceptual
  agent can be a victim of a perceptual illusion, only a _conscious_
  agent can be an _appreciator_ of such things. From an evolutionary
  point of view it is sometimes useful to be able to distinguish between
  _the way the world seems_ and the way we believe the world to be.
* This represention of the way the world seems does not need to take the
  form of an explicit internal image (cf. "finding out vs. filling in"
  debate). But _it is nevertheless a representation of the way the world
  seems_. It is simply a representation which is built on an as-needed
  basis: when some behaviour about "the way the world seems" is needed,
  the brain generates a judgement about the way the world seems -
  perhaps by initiating an action, such as a visual saccade, to acquire
  the needed information, or perhaps by retroactively constructing it by
  analysing a lingering trace of some earlier perceptual process.
  Functionally-speaking, this is equivalently to "eagerly" computing the
  represention up front, but is much more computationally tractable.
  This is essentially Dennett's "multiple drafts" theory of consciousness.
* We don't get to "observe that we're conscious". We can't, as Chalmers
  does, make the "public" claim that he's "obviously conscious" from his
  own point view and have that simultaneously be a claim that is somehow
  a consequence of his having "further fact"-style consciousness.
  Rather, to _be_ a conscious agent is, at least to some extent, to be
  conscious of being conscious; this is somewhat "observation-like". But
  the minute I'm speaking to you and describing what's it like to be me,
  we're back in the realm of things that are, by definition, fully
  explicable via a physical story.

## Overall structure

* _Situate_ my story broadly in the materialist, Dennettian framework
* _Summarise_ my overall claim. Restrict this by wordcount, e.g. 500 or 1000 words.
* Set out key _novelties_ of my position (since much will not be novel,
  merely freshly presented)
* List of key _challenges_ that I need a specific response to
  * Zombie hypothesis
  * Mary
  * Inverted spectrum
  * Similar inverted-spectrum-like qualia-related challenges
  * "Neural correlate" (psychophysical isomorphism) intuition
* List of challenges that I don't know how to respond to
* Extensive bibliography

# Themes

## Consciousness as _functionality_ (observable behavior)

While it seems to us that consciousness is an inherently _private_
affair, I believe this _notion_ of an inner, private life is
fundamentally _public_. Being a conscious agent is _functionality_ that
I implement. Natural selection "designed" us to be conscious agents by
selecting for that observable behaviour. Consciousness is a designed
feature in exactly the sense that a heart is designed to pump blood
around the body.

## Burden tennis

David Chalmers does an excellent job of spelling out the intuition that
any scientific account of consciousness will _necessarily_ fall short of
a full explanation. (This is what Joseph Levine famously called the
"explanatory gap".) According to Chalmers, the best a scientific account
can do is provide an explanation of the physical mechanisms that seem to
_accompany_ consciousness -- the neural goings-on that correlate with
conscious phenomena. For example [cite Dehaene] recent experiments have
revealed differences in brain activity when we report a conscious
percept versus when the same stimulus is presented to us in such a way
that we are not conscious of it. Chalmer's intuition -- and it is such a
compelling one that I think many share it -- is that _however much_ we
discover about the difference in brain activity between conscious states
and non-conscious ones, we make _no progress at all_ on understanding
_why_ the conscious states actually involve consciousness. It seems that
all the things conscious matter does can be done perfectly well without
consciousness.

Teed Rockwell described this stand-off between Dennett and Chalmers as
"burden tennis". Each believes the burden of proof lies with the other.
Dennett believes Chalmers has failed to show that there are any
phenomena that remain to be accounted for, once all the behaviour is
accounted for. Chalmers argues that Dennett must _either_ admit that the
materialist story inherently falls short of a full explanation, _or_ why
we have such a strong intuition that this is the case.

Although the account of consciousness I want to develop here builds on
Dennett's, I believe that in this particular respect Chalmers is right:
the burden of proof does indeed lie with the _materialist_ to explain
the "anti-materialist intuition". This is a challenge I want to tackle
head-on.
