# The Virtual Cartesian Theatre

When we think about our own consciousness, there seems to be an
irreconcilable gap between the material world and the mental. In the
material world we find all the mind-stuff that is observable to science:
brains, neurons, synapses, neurochemical pathways. Things in the
material world are _public_ in the sense that if make some observation
of it then in principle at any rate you could have made a similar
observation and learned essentially the same thing.

The realm of _conscious minds_ seems to be something that exists _in
addition_ to this. For example, to many people it seems quite plausible
that even if one could build a robot which behaved in every way like a
person, it would be possible for that robot to lack an "inner life".
(This is sometimes called the _zombie hypothesis_.) A related intution
is that however much we understand about the mechanics or workings of
the brain, it seems to be a mysterious additional fact that we also have
"inner lives". Moreover facts about our inner lives seem to be _private_
in a way that facts about the material world are not. I can tell you
what it is like to be me, but there is no shared part of the world I can
point to say "that is what it is like to be me".

Following David Chalmers, I will call this the _further fact_ intuition.
The further fact intution is compelling. It has lead some philosophers,
notably Chalmers, to argue that the scientific world-view needs to be
extended to include consciousness as a new primitive ingredient. Others,
such as Daniel Dennett, have argued that the further fact intuition is
just a false intuition.

some aspects of the folk image
-- in particular qualia, and the sense that our consciousness
phenomenonology is "plenum", a rich sensory world-image something like a
movie in the brain -- are confused or illusory.

I have a tentative answer to this question. I believe consciousness can
be understood as a _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_, a mechanism designed by
evolution that embues us, and perhaps some animals, with a specific kind
of reflective behaviour. Unlike Descartes' theatre of the mind, the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre is implemented solely in matter. A Virtual
Cartesian Theatre can be implemented in any computational medium
(although no-one is saying it will be easy). Ours was designed by
evolutionary processes and implemented in biochemistry. A key function
of the mechanism is to generate an elaborate form of
"point-of-view"-oriented behaviour that we call consciousness.

What seems wrong with what I just wrote is that a theory of
consciousness which treats conscious merely as behaviour _must_ leave
something out, almost by definition. The _essence_ of consciousness --
the interesting bit -- isn't just that we _behave_ in interesting ways.
It is the feeling of being "inside our own minds", like we're looking
out at the world through our senses, occupying a unique locus in time
and space, perhaps even watching a "movie in the brain" [Damasio].

Profoundly compelling though it is, I believe this intuition -- that
there is more to consciousness than behaviour -- is also profoundly
wrong. The sense that we are inside our own minds, looking out, perhaps
"observers" of our own consciousness, _is itself nothing more than a
complex feature of our behaviour_. This is by far the hardest part of
the story to understand, and a significant portion of this website will
be devoted to trying to explain it. What I just said seems _obviously
false_. And yet, with some effort, it seems to be possible to understand
consciousness in this way.
