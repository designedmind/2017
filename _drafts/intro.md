# The Virtual Cartesian Theatre

Our everyday intuitions cleave the natural world into two realms: the
material and the mental. The realm of _matter_ (and related things, like
_fundamental forces_) is where all the stuff observable to science
happens. The realm of _conscious minds_ seems inherently _private_: for
example it may seem plausible that one could build a robot which behaved
in every way like a person, but was not conscious. (This is sometimes
called the _zombie hypothesis_.) Yet although matter and mind seem
fundamentally distinct, they also seem to interact in interesting ways.

There seems to be rather large gap between the "scientific image", and
our everyday intuitions (the "folk image"). As scientists we may believe
it is matter doing the thinking. But as _people_ we find it hard to
comprehend that there may be nothing more to us than matter.

[Dennett vs. Chalmers] "Explained away" vs. brand-new theory

I have a tentative answer to this question. I believe consciousness can
be understood as a _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_, a mechanism designed by
evolution that embues us, and perhaps some animals, with a specific kind
of reflective behaviour. Unlike Descartes' theatre of the mind, the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre is implemented solely in matter. A Virtual
Cartesian Theatre can be implemented in any computational medium
(although no-one is saying it will be easy). Ours was designed by
evolutionary processes and implemented in biochemistry. A key function
of the mechanism is to generate an elaborate form of
"point-of-view"-oriented behaviour that we call consciousness.

What seems wrong with what I just wrote is that a theory of
consciousness which treats conscious merely as behaviour _must_ leave
something out, almost by definition. The _essence_ of consciousness --
the interesting bit -- isn't just that we _behave_ in interesting ways.
It is the feeling of being "inside our own minds", like we're looking
out at the world through our senses, occupying a unique locus in time
and space, perhaps even watching a "movie in the brain" [Damasio].

Profoundly compelling though it is, I believe this intuition -- that
there is more to consciousness than behaviour -- is also profoundly
wrong. The sense that we are inside our own minds, looking out, perhaps
"observers" of our own consciousness, _is itself nothing more than a
complex feature of our behaviour_. This is by far the hardest part of
the story to understand, and a significant portion of this website will
be devoted to trying to explain it. What I just said seems _obviously
false_. And yet, with some effort, it seems to be possible to understand
consciousness in this way.

The _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_ builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. Whereas Dennett explicitly rejects the language of
qualia and "movies in the brain" as vestiges of Cartesian Dualism, the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre _recasts_ them as robust features of our
behaviour, fitting them, ironically maybe, into a fully Dennettian
world-view. Dennett's approach, according to some critics, "explains
away" consciousness, disregarding most of our non-materialism
intuitions. I believe a complete scientific theory of consciousness
requires construing our non-materialist intuitions as _features of_
consciousness, part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than
lingering confusion about it.

The paragraphs above are little more than a sketch, full of outlandish
claims and impressionistic language. This document is my attempt to
unpack them into something much more comprehensive.
