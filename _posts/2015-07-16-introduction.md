# Introduction

This is an embryonic sketch of a theory of consciousness I call the
_Virtual Cartesian Theatre_. Some aspects of the Virtual Cartesian
Theatre are new; many are not. In particular it builds substantially on
the insights of Daniel Dennett.

The starting point of my account is Dennett's multiple-drafts theory of
consciousness. The multiple-drafts model allows consciousness, with some
effort, to be understood as an elaborate form of behaviour structured
around an internal narrative. Dennett's theory is profound, but many
find it extremely unsatisfying. The most common criticism is that rather
than _explaining_ consciousness, Dennett "explains it away", somehow
disregarding the very phenomenon that needs explanation.

I am enthusiastic about the shift in perspective that Dennett
introduced, but I agree that it falls short of an account of
consciousness. Where he goes wrong is in rejecting the idea that there
is a "coming together", a Central Image for the mind's eye to inspect.
For example, Dennett goes to some length in Conscious Explained to argue
that

> “The eventual “products” of vision are such things as guided hand and
> finger motions, involuntary ducking, exclamations of surprise, triggering
> of ancient memories, sexual arousal, ... and none of these is imagistic
> in any sense...”

I believe this description of vision is simply incorrect. The content of
the narrative that generates our _vision-related behaviour_ is indeed
often extremely imagistic. This doesn't mean one could peek into
someone's brain and literally find a structure representing an image.
Rather, the claim is that our self-narratives often have components that
are, functionally-speaking, images. More generally, our everyday
intuitions about the mind, which are very Cartesian in flavour, are
themselves part of the content of the narrative and thus can be
understood in purely materialist terms.

The Virtual Cartesian Theatre construes our non-materialist
intuitions as _features of_ consciousness, part of the phenomenon to be
explained, rather than lingering confusion about it.

Indeed, one of my main claims will be that our self-narratives are
functionally organised in way that is very reminiscent of the Cartesian
Theatre that the materialist must (in any _literal_ sense) reject. This
recasts our Cartesian intuitions as robust _features of our behaviour_.
While it is sensible to reject a very literal view of a "coming
together", I will argue that there is a _functional_ coming together
which is perhaps the essence of conscious experience.

This fits them into a Dennettian, multiple-drafts-style view of
consciousness. So in a sense I part company with Dennett only by pushing
some of his own ideas further than he is prepared to push them.
