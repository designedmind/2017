summary: "Dennett's theory is a breakthrough, but falls short of an
account of phenomenal consciousness."

---

This web essay is an embryonic sketch of a theory of consciousness I
call the _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_. Some aspects of the idea are new;
others are not. In particular it builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. A key difference, _vis à vis_ Dennett, is that the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre construes our non-materialist intuitions about
the mind as _central features of_ consciousness. These intuitions are
part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than lingering confusion
about it.

My starting point is Dennett's so-called "multiple drafts" theory, as
set out in his 1991 book [Consciousness Explained](#dennett91a). Dennett
proposes that we understand consciousness as an elaborate form of
_behaviour_, driven by narrative-building mechanisms in the brain. The
"multiple" in multiple drafts refers to the fact that there is no unique
global narrative defining the content of my consciousness, but rather
distinct strands of narrative competing for an opportunity to influence
behaviour. "Drafts" refers to the tentative nature of the content: the
official story of "what it was like to be me at time _t_" may be revised
over time in the light of further sensory input or processing.

Dennett's theory is profound, but many find it extremely unsatisfying.
The most common criticism, articulated by David Chalmers among others,
is that by accounting only for mechanism and behaviour, the scope of
Dennett's theory necessarily excludes the key phenomenon in need of
explanation, namely the fact that _it is like something_ to be me. At
best Dennett's theory may explain the "observable" aspects of
consciousness, such as verbal reports, having little, if anything, to
say about our inner, private lives.

I have a lot of sympathy with this objection. It does indeed seem that
Dennett neglects the central mystery, namely how matter comes to have
subjective experience. Nevertheless, I believe it is possible to use the
core ingredients of Dennett's theory to explain this apparent mystery
purely in terms of function and behaviour. To do so requires looking at
Dennett's multiple drafts model in a new way.

Rather than taking the multiple drafts model as a "deconstruction" of
the Cartesian theatre -- an argument to the effect that, since there is
no place in the brain where it all "comes together", there is no coming
together of any kind -- we should see it as a sketch of how a
_functional_ coming together might be implemented.

Dennett himself seems unable to make this move because of his
well-meaning but ultimately misguided wariness of Cartesian thinking. On
the subject of visual perception, for example, Dennett is unhesitating
in his rejection of a "coming together", of an internal image for the
mind's eye to inspect:

> “The eventual “products” of vision are such things as guided hand and
> finger motions, involuntary ducking, exclamations of surprise, triggering
> of ancient memories, sexual arousal, ... and none of these is imagistic
> in any sense...” [(BBS commentary on Pylyshyn)](#dennett02)

It is not hard to understand why Dennett is so opposed to the idea that
the job of vision is to produce an inner image. The idea of seeing as
the observation of an internal performance on a phenomenal stage -- the
dreaded "Cartesian theatre" -- is antithetical to the standard
materialist world view, and certainly invites a worry about infinite
regress. While the commitment to materialism is admirable, Dennett's
description of vision here is inaccurate:

As a taster of the key claim I will be making in this essay, start with
the following observation: contrary to Dennett, there are in fact many
imagistic aspects of visual behaviour. By this I mean that there are
many respects in which we _behave_ as though our visual percepts are a
kind of inner presentation -- in the sense that our "mind's eye" is able
to freely roam over the percept itself. Examples that I will explore in
detail over the coming months include the way we report visual
illusions, entopic phenomena like
[floaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater), optical effects like
parallax, and hallucinations induced by psychoactive drugs. These are
all "behavioural outputs" of vision that are profoundly imagistic.

The emphasis on the word _behave_ in the previous paragraph is crucial.
This aspect of human visual perception is not -- as philosophers such as
Chalmers tend to presume -- a "further fact" about perception that
exists beyond function or behaviour, a purely private phenomenon
correlated with but somehow in addition to neural activity. Rather, it
is an overt (and presumably useful in some evolutionary sense) aspect of
our behaviour: a feature, not an epiphenomenon. We are able _not only_
to use vision to "get by" in the world (identify mates, avoid predators)
_but also_ to behave deeply and systematically about the content of
visual percepts. These are two distinct visual capabilities -- a
"first-order" capability that triggers hand movements, involuntary
duckings, sexual arousal and whatnot, and a "second-order" capability
that allows us to behave about vision itself. I believe that
understanding this properly is the key to understanding phenomenal
consciousness.

If we were somehow able to peek into the brain of a seeing person, would
we find patterns of neural activation that resemble images? No. Rather,
my claim is that our self-narratives often have content that is
_functionally_ image-like, regardless of how that behaviour is
implemented or that content represented. It is in this important,
functional, sense that there an inner presentation. Indeed it is the
functional role of the narrative in these situations as an enabler of
"behaviour about percepts" that warrants describing it as an inner
image. The implementation technique may be quite clever, building the
representation on demand and only instantiating as much structure as is
required to meet the demands of the task at hand. But these are mere
implementation detail. Our "selves" live on the outside of that clever
abstraction.

This a functional inner presentation is what I mean by the Virtual
Cartesian Theatre. Putting some flesh on the bones of this idea is the
purpose of this essay.
