summary: "Dennett's theory is a breakthrough, but falls short of an
account of phenomenal consciousness."

---

This web essay is an embryonic sketch of a theory of consciousness I
call the _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_. Some aspects of the idea are new;
others are not. In particular it builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. A key difference, _vis à vis_ Dennett, is that the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre construes our non-materialist intuitions about
the mind as _central features of_ consciousness. These intuitions are
part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than lingering confusion
about it.

The starting point of my account is Dennett's so-called "multiple
drafts" theory, as set out in his 1991 book
[Consciousness Explained](#dennett91a). Dennett's theory proposes that
we understand consciousness as an elaborate form of _behaviour_, driven
by narrative-building mechanisms in the brain. The "multiple" in
multiple drafts refers to the fact that there is no unique global
narrative defining the content of my consciousness, but rather distinct
strands of narrative competing for an opportunity to influence
behaviour. "Drafts" refers to the tentative nature of the content: the
official story of "what it was like to be me at time _t_" may be revised
over time in the light of further sensory input or processing.

Dennett's theory is profound, but many find it extremely unsatisfying.
The most common criticism, articulated by David Chalmers among others,
is that by accounting only for function, or behaviour, the scope of
Dennett's theory necessarily excludes the key phenomenon in need of
explanation, namely the fact that _it is like something_ to be me. At
best Dennett's theory may explain the "observable" aspects of
consciousness, such as verbal reports, having little if anything to say
about our inner, private lives.

I have a lot of sympathy with this objection. It does indeed seem that
Dennett neglects the central mystery, namely how matter comes to have
subjective experience. Nevertheless, I believe it is possible to use the
core ingredients of Dennett's theory to explain this apparently mystery
purely in terms of function and behaviour. To do so requires looking at
Dennett's multiple drafts model in a new way.

Dennett himself seems unable to make this move because of his
well-meaning but ultimately misguided wariness of Cartesian thinking. On
the subject of visual perception, for example, Dennett is unhesitating
in his rejection of a "coming together", of an internal image for the
mind's eye to inspect:

> “The eventual “products” of vision are such things as guided hand and
> finger motions, involuntary ducking, exclamations of surprise, triggering
> of ancient memories, sexual arousal, ... and none of these is imagistic
> in any sense...” [(BBS commentary on Pylyshyn)](#dennett02)

It is not hard to understand why Dennett is so opposed to the idea that
the job of vision is to produce an inner image. The idea of seeing as
the observation of an internal performance on a phenomenal stage -- the
dreaded "Cartesian theatre" -- is antithetical to the standard
materialist world view, and certainly invites a worry about infinite
regress. While the commitment to materialism is admirable, Dennett's
description of vision here is inaccurate:

As a taster of the key claim I will be making in this essay, start with
the following observation: contrary to Dennett, there are in fact many
imagistic aspects of visual behaviour. By this I mean that there are
many respects in which we _behave as though_ our visual percepts are a
kind of inner presentation -- in the sense that our "mind's eye" is able
to freely roam over the percept itself. The emphasis on the word
"behave" here is crucial: this aspect of human visual perception is not
-- as some philosophers might have it -- a "further fact" about
perception that exists beyond function or behaviour, but is an overt
overt (and presumably "useful" in some evolutionary sense) aspect of our
organismic function. The ability _not only_ to use vision to "get by" in
the world (identify mates, avoid predators) _but also_ to behave deeply
and systematically about the content of our percepts. This shearing of
vision into two components -- a "first-order" component that guides hand
movements, cause duckings, or elicits sexual arousal, and a
"second-order" component that allows us to behave about vision itself --
is part of our phenotype. I believe that understanding this properly is
the key to understanding phenomenal consciousness.

Examples that I will explore in detail over the coming months include
the way we report visual illusions, entopic phenomena like
[floaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater), parallax, and
hallucinations induced by psychoactive drugs. These are all "behavioural
outputs" of vision that are profoundly imagistic.

If we were somehow able to peek into the brain of a seeing person, would
we find patterns of neural activation that resemble images? No. Rather,
my claim is that our self-narratives often have content that is
_functionally_ image-like, and that the associated behaviours are
similarly imagistic. It is in this important, functional, sense that
there an inner presentation. Indeed the functional role of the narrative
in this situation is _precisely_ to serve as an inner image of sorts:
the narrative has as its content the phenomenonal image. The
implementation technique may be quite clever, building the
representation on demand and only instantiating as much structure as is
required to meet the demands of the task at hand. But these are mere
implementation detail, and our "selves" live on the outside of the
abstraction.

Such a functional inner presentation is what I mean by the Virtual
Cartesian Theatre. Putting some flesh on the bones of this idea is the
purpose of this essay.
