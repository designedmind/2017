summary: "Dennett's theory is a breakthrough, but falls short of an
account of phenomenal consciousness."

---

This web essay is an embryonic sketch of a theory of consciousness I
call the _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_. Some aspects of the idea are new;
others are not. In particular it builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. A key difference, _vis à vis_ Dennett, is that the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre construes our non-materialist intuitions about
the mind as _central features of_ consciousness. These intuitions are
part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than lingering confusion
about it.

The starting point of my account is Dennett's so-called "multiple
drafts" theory, as set out in his 1991 book
[Consciousness Explained](#dennett91a). The multiple drafts model
positions consciousness as an elaborate form of _behaviour_, driven by
narrative-building mechanisms in the brain. The "multiple drafts" refers
to the fact that there is no unique global narrative that defines the
content of my consciousness but rather there are various strands of
narrative fighting for their opportunity to influence behaviour, any of
them subject to revision in the light of further sensory input.

Dennett's theory is profound, but many find it extremely unsatisfying.
The most common criticism is that by assuming that function, or
behaviour, is all that needs to be accounted for, Dennett's theory
disregards the very thing that needs explaining, namely the fact that
_it is like something to be me_. Indeed, far from _explaining_
consciousness, Dennett's story does little more than "explain it away".

I am enthusiastic about the shift in perspective that Dennett's book
introduced. I hope it will one day be recognised as a watershed moment
in our understanding of consciousness. Nevertheless, it falls short.
While many of the core ingredients are in place, Dennett is tripped up
by a well-meaning but ultimately misguided wariness of Cartesian
thinking. On the subject of visual perception, for example, Dennett
unwaveringly rejects any idea of a "coming together", an internal image
for the mind's eye to inspect:

> “The eventual “products” of vision are such things as guided hand and
> finger motions, involuntary ducking, exclamations of surprise, triggering
> of ancient memories, sexual arousal, ... and none of these is imagistic
> in any sense...” [(BBS commentary on Pylyshyn)](#dennett02)

It is not hard to understand why Dennett is so opposed to the idea that
the job of vision is not to produce an inner image. The idea of seeing
as the observation of an internal performance on a phenomenal stage --
the dreaded "Cartesian theatre" -- is antithetical to the standard
materialist world view. While the commitment to materialism is
admirable, Dennett's description of vision here is inaccurate:

As a taster of the key claim I will be making in this essay, start with
the following observation: contrary to Dennett, there are in fact many
imagistic aspects of visual behaviour. By this I mean that there are
many respects in which we _behave as though_ our visual percepts were
"presented" -- in such a way that our "mind's eye" is able to freely
roam over the percept itself. I emphasised the word "behave" here
because this aspect of visual perception in humans is not -- as some
philosophers might have it -- a "further fact" about perception that
exists beyond function or behaviour, but is part of our overt (and
presumably evolved) "functionality" as organisms. The ability to _not
only_ use vision to "get by" in the world (identify mates, avoid
predators) _but also_ to behave deeply and systematically about the
content of our percepts is part of our phenotype. I believe that to
understand this properly is to understand phenomenal consciousness.

Examples that I will explore in
detail over the coming months include the way we report visual
illusions, entopic phenomena like
[floaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater), parallax, and
hallucinations induced by psychoactive drugs. These are all "behavioural
outputs" of vision that are profoundly imagistic.

The key point is that _vision_ and _visual phenomenology_ are not the
same thing. When the only _purpose_ of vision is to guide hand
movements, induce duckings, and elicit sexual arousal, these are indeed
the end products of vision. But when the requirements placed on our
visual capabilities are extended to include elaborate verbal reports .
It is because our vision these particular evolved functions that

Does this mean that if we were somehow able to peek into the brain of
someone while they were seeing, that we should expect to find image-like
patterns of neural activation? No. Rather, it is to say that our
self-narratives often have content that is _functionally image-like_,
and that the associated behaviours are similarly imagistic. It is in
this important, functional, sense that there an inner presentation.
Indeed the functional role of the narrative in this situation is
_precisely_ to serve as an inner image of sorts: the narrative has as
its content the phenomenonal image. Of course the implementation
technique may be quite clever, building the representation on demand and
only instantiating as much internal structure as is required to meet the
demands of the task at hand. But these are mere implementation detail,
and our "selves" live on the outside of the abstraction.

Such a functional inner presentation is what I mean by the Virtual
Cartesian Theatre. Putting some flesh on the bones of this idea is the
purpose of this essay.
