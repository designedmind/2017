summary: "Dennett's theory is a breakthrough, but falls short of an
account of phenomenal consciousness."

---

This web essay is an embryonic sketch of a theory of consciousness I
call the _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_. Some aspects of the idea are new;
others are not. In particular it builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. A key difference, _vis à vis_ Dennett, is that the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre construes our non-materialist intuitions about
the mind as _central features of_ consciousness. These intuitions are
part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than lingering confusion
about it.

The starting point of my account is Dennett's multiple-drafts theory of
consciousness, as set out in his 1991 book
[Consciousness Explained](#dennett91a). The multiple-drafts model
positions consciousness as an elaborate form of _behaviour_ structured
around an internal narrative. Dennett's theory is profound, but many
find it extremely unsatisfying. The most common criticism is that by
arguing that function, or behaviour, is all that needs to be accounted
for, Dennett's theory disregards the very things that needs explaining,
namely the fact that _it is like something to be me_. Rather than
_explaining_ consciousness, Dennett's story "explains it away".

I am enthusiastic about the shift in perspective that Dennett's book
introduced. However, I agree that it falls short of an account of
consciousness. The core of Dennett's problem is his (_prima facie_
reasonable) rejection of any idea of a "coming together", an internal
image for the mind's eye to inspect.

For example, in a [BBS commentary on Pylyshyn](#dennett02) Dennett
suggests that

> “The eventual “products” of vision are such things as guided hand and
> finger motions, involuntary ducking, exclamations of surprise, triggering
> of ancient memories, sexual arousal, ... and none of these is imagistic
> in any sense...”

Dennett's skepticism regarding a literal construal of imagery is
unsurprising, given his materialist pedigree and the obvious echos of
the "classical" Cartesian theatre in the idea of an inner image. While
his commitment to materialism is admirable, Dennett's description of
vision here is simply inaccurate: in fact there are _many_ imagistic
components of visual behaviour. Examples that I will explore in detail
over the coming months include the way we report visual illusions,
entopic phenomena like
[floaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater), parallax, and
hallucinations induced by psychoactive drugs. These are all "behavioural
outputs" of vision that are profoundly imagistic.

This is not to say that if we were somehow able to peek into the brain
of someone while they were seeing, that we should expect to find
image-like patterns of neural activation. Rather, it is to say that our
self-narratives often have content that is _functionally_ image-like,
and that the associated behaviours are similarly imagistic. In this
important, functional, sense there _is_ an inner presentation. Indeed
the functional role of the narrative in this situation is _precisely_ to
serve as an inner image of sorts, _precisely_ to enable this kind of
"imagistic" behaviour.

Such a functional coming-together is what I mean by the Virtual
Cartesian Theatre. Putting some flesh on the bones of this idea is the
purpose of this blog.
