summary: "Dennett's theory is a breakthrough, but falls short of an
account of phenomenal consciousness."

---

This web essay is an embryonic sketch of a theory of consciousness I
call the _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_. Some aspects of the idea are new;
others are not. In particular it builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. A key difference, _vis à vis_ Dennett, is that the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre construes our non-materialist intuitions about
the mind as _central features of_ consciousness. These intuitions are
part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than lingering confusion
about it.

The starting point of my account is Dennett's so-called "multiple
drafts" theory, as set out in his 1991 book
[Consciousness Explained](#dennett91a). The multiple drafts model
positions consciousness as an elaborate form of _behaviour_, driven by
narrative-building mechanisms in the brain. Dennett's theory is
profound, but many find it extremely unsatisfying. The most common
criticism is that by assuming that function, or behaviour, is all that
needs to be accounted for, Dennett's theory disregards the very thing
that needs explaining, namely the fact that _it is like something to be
me_. Indeed, far from _explaining_ consciousness, Dennett's story does
little more than "explain it away".

I am enthusiastic about the shift in perspective that Dennett's book
introduced. I think it will one day be recognised as a watershed moment
in our understanding of consciousness. Nevertheless, it still falls
short of an account of consciousness. While many of the core ingredients
are in place, Dennett is tripped up by a well-meaning but ultimately
misguided wariness of anything that sounds remotely Cartesian. The core
of Dennett's problem is his (_prima facie_ reasonable) rejection of any
idea of a "coming together", an internal image for the mind's eye to
inspect.

For example, in a [BBS commentary on Pylyshyn](#dennett02) Dennett
suggests that

> “The eventual “products” of vision are such things as guided hand and
> finger motions, involuntary ducking, exclamations of surprise, triggering
> of ancient memories, sexual arousal, ... and none of these is imagistic
> in any sense...”

It is not hard to understand why Dennett is so adamant that the job of
vision is not to produce an image. is unsurprising, given his
materialist pedigree and the obvious echos of the dreaded Cartesian
theatre in the idea of an inner image. While his commitment to
materialism is admirable, Dennett's description of vision here is simply
inaccurate: in fact there are _many_ imagistic components of visual
behaviour. Examples that I will explore in detail over the coming months
include the way we report visual illusions, entopic phenomena like
[floaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater), parallax, and
hallucinations induced by psychoactive drugs. These are all "behavioural
outputs" of vision that are profoundly imagistic.

This is not to say that if we were somehow able to peek into the brain
of someone while they were seeing, that we should expect to find
image-like patterns of neural activation. Rather, it is to say that our
self-narratives often have content that is _functionally_ image-like,
and that the associated behaviours are similarly imagistic. In this
important, functional, sense there _is_ an inner presentation. Indeed
the functional role of the narrative in this situation is _precisely_ to
serve as an inner image of sorts, _precisely_ to enable this kind of
"imagistic" behaviour.

Such a functional inner presentation is what I mean by the Virtual
Cartesian Theatre. Putting some flesh on the bones of this idea is the
purpose of this essay.
