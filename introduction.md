summary: "Dennett's theory is a breakthrough, but falls short of an
account of phenomenal consciousness."

---

This web essay is an embryonic sketch of a theory of consciousness I
call the _Virtual Cartesian Theatre_. Some aspects of the idea are new;
others are not. In particular it builds substantially on the insights of
Daniel Dennett. A key difference, _vis à vis_ Dennett, is that the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre construes our non-materialist intuitions about
the mind as _central features of_ consciousness. These intuitions are
part of the phenomenon to be explained, rather than lingering confusion
about it.

My starting point is Dennett's so-called "multiple drafts" theory, as
set out in his 1991 book [Consciousness Explained](#dennett91a). Dennett
proposes that we understand consciousness as an elaborate form of
_behaviour_, driven by narrative-building mechanisms in the brain. The
"multiple" in multiple drafts refers to the fact that there is no unique
global narrative defining the content of my consciousness, but rather
distinct strands of narrative competing for an opportunity to influence
behaviour. "Drafts" refers to the tentative nature of the content: the
official story of "what it was like to be me at time _t_" may be revised
over time in the light of further sensory input or processing.

Dennett's theory is profound, but many find it extremely unsatisfying.
The most common criticism, articulated most vocally by David Chalmers,
is that by accounting only for mechanism and behaviour, the scope of
Dennett's theory necessarily excludes the key phenomenon in need of
explanation, namely the fact that _it is like something_ to be me. At
best Dennett's theory may explain the "observable" aspects of
consciousness, such as verbal reports, having little, if anything, to
say about our inner, private lives.

I have a lot of sympathy with this objection. It does indeed seem that
Dennett neglects the central mystery, namely how matter comes to have
subjective experience. Nevertheless, I believe it is possible to use the
core ingredients of Dennett's theory to explain this apparent mystery
purely in terms of function and behaviour. To do so requires looking at
Dennett's multiple drafts model in a new way.

Rather than taking it as a "deconstruction" of the Cartesian theatre --
an argument to the effect that, since there is no place in the brain
where it all "comes together", there is no coming together of any kind
-- I shall argue that we should see the multiple drafts model as a
"reconstruction" of a (virtual) Cartesian theatre, a sketch of how a
_functional_ coming together might be implemented. This seems to hold
the best prospects for reconciling the scientific image of mind as
mechanism with the "manifest" image of ourselves as conscious agents
with rich phenomenal lives.

This move remains blocked to Dennett as long as he resists the idea that
any aspect of perception can resemble an inner presentation. On this
particular question, Dennett is adamant. Regarding visual perception,
for example, Dennett is unhesitating in his rejection of a "coming
together", of an internal image for the mind's eye to inspect:

> “The eventual “products” of vision are such things as guided hand and
> finger motions, involuntary ducking, exclamations of surprise, triggering
> of ancient memories, sexual arousal, ... and none of these is imagistic
> in any sense...” [(BBS commentary on Pylyshyn)](#dennett02)

To a materialist, Dennett's opposition to the idea that vision might
involve an inner image may seem reasonable. After all, the idea of
seeing as the observation of an internal performance on a phenomenal
stage -- the dreaded "Cartesian theatre" -- is quite antithetical to the
standard materialist picture. Since no-one takes _substance_ dualism
seriously any more, perhaps there is a materialist tendency to
over-compensate, tarring anything resembling the Cartesian model with
the same brush. Unfortunately (and switching metaphors) this throws the
baby out with the bathwater.

Indeed, one does not have to look far to find (behavioural, functional)
products of vision which very much resemble an inner presentation -- in
the sense that our "mind's eye" is able to freely roam over a "percept".
Examples that I will explore in detail over the coming months include
the way we report visual illusions, entopic phenomena like
[floaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater), optical effects like
parallax, and hallucinations induced by psychoactive drugs. These are
all "behavioural outputs" of vision that are profoundly imagistic.

The emphasis on the word _behave_ in the previous paragraph is crucial.
Visual phenomenology is not -- as philosophers such as Chalmers have
presumed -- a "further fact" about perception, a purely private affair
correlated with but somehow supplementary to neural mechanism and
behaviour. Rather, phenomenology is an overt feature of behaviour:
functional, not epiphenomenal. We are able _not only_ to use vision to
"get by" in the world (identify mates, avoid predators) _but also_ to
behave deeply and systematically about the content of visual percepts.
These are two distinct visual capabilities -- a "first-order" capability
that triggers hand movements, involuntary duckings, sexual arousal and
whatnot, and a "second-order" capability that allows us to behave about
vision itself. I believe that understanding this distinction properly is
the crucial step in understanding phenomenal consciousness.

If we were able to peek into the brain of a seeing person, would we find
patterns of neural activation that resemble images? No. Rather, my claim
is that we would find perceptual content that is _functionally_
image-like, in the sense that it enables "behaviour about percepts". It
is only in this functional sense that there an inner presentation. The
claim remains neutral about how that behaviour is implemented or that
content represented. The implementation techniques may be quite clever,
building the representation on demand and only instantiating as much
structure as is required to meet the demands of the task at hand. But
these are mere implementation detail. Our "selves" live on the outside
of that powerful abstraction.

This functional inner presentation is what I mean by the Virtual
Cartesian Theatre. Putting some flesh on the bones of this idea is the
purpose of this essay.
