# Burden tennis

* It seems _both_ the materialists _and_ the "Chalmerians" need to
  acknowledge that phenomenology is a key functional component of human
  behaviour.

# Consciousness as designed functionality.

* Like a heart is a designed to work as a pump, consciousness is
  designed to serve certain behavioural functions. The designer here is
  of course natural selection, not an intelligent designer. I chose to
  use the word "designed" to emphasise that consciousness serves a
  _function_, rather than being a spurious side-effect of having a
  certain kind of brain, or exhibiting a certain kind of behaviour.
  Consciousness is neither an epiphenomon nor an unobservable, private
  affair; it is a particular kind of behaviour carved out by natural
  selection.

* One of the key functions of consciousness is to allow an evolved agent
  to treat its own _perceptual judgements_ -- judgements which are not
  themselves conscious -- as data. Perceptual illusions are an excellent
  example. While any perceptual agent can be a _victim_ of a perceptual
  illusion, only a conscious agent can _appreciate_ one. (From an
  evolutionary point of view it is sometimes useful to be able to
  distinguish between _the way the world seems_ and the way we believe
  the world to be.) Other examples include conscious awareness of
  hallucinations induced by hallucinogenic drugs, and of optical effects
  such as parallax. [Relationship of this to HOT theories.]

* This represention of the way the world seems does not need to take the
  form of an explicit internal image (cf. "finding out vs. filling in"
  debate). But it _is_ nevertheless a representation of the way the
  world seems. It is simply a representation which is built on an
  as-needed basis: when behaviour about "the way the world seems" is
  needed, the brain generates a judgement about the way the world seems.
  This may involve -- perhaps first initiating an action, such as a
  visual saccade, to acquire the needed information, or perhaps by
  retroactively constructing it by analysing a lingering trace of some
  earlier perceptual process. Functionally-speaking, this is
  equivalently to "eagerly" computing the represention up front, but is
  much more computationally tractable. This is essentially Dennett's
  "multiple drafts" theory of consciousness.

# Phenomenology

* Consciousness as the leading edge of perceptual memory -- yes, but not
  in the sense intended by whoever it was who said this. It's not that
  phenomenal experience comes first and is then etched down into memory;
  rather, phenomenal experience _is_ a kind of readily accessible
  perceptual memory.

* Need to be aware of Block's distinction between "access" and
  "phenomenal" consciousness.

* We don't get to "observe that we're conscious". We can't, as Chalmers
  does, make the "public" claim that he's "obviously conscious" from his
  own point view and have that simultaneously be a claim that is somehow
  a consequence of his having "further fact"-style consciousness.
  Rather, to _be_ a conscious agent is, at least to some extent, to be
  conscious of being conscious; this is somewhat "observation-like". But
  the minute I'm speaking to you and describing what's it like to be me,
  we're back in the realm of things that are, by definition, fully
  explicable via a physical story.

* When we "recall" how something looked (or how pain felt) we are not
  _remembering the phenomenology_ of vision or pain. Rather, _the
  remembering is the phenomenology_, i.e. the "phenomenology" is the
  content of the past narrative that informs our current behaviour.

* Relatedly, consider the situation when we suddenly become aware of a
  noise that has been present for sometime but we were previously
  unaware of. Phenomenal awareness of the noise _is_ just the
  (retroactive) acknowledgement of the percept. Now consider
  non-conscious percepts where the subsequent registration of that
  percept in the narrative never occurs. Such a percept never enters the
  "phenomenal stage". Now imagine an organism where _all_ percepts are
  of this nature. This is perception without consciousness.

# Free-floating rationales

* The _behaviour_ of living things is "intentional", in the sense of
  being _about_ something, or having a _subject matter_. Human visual
  behaviour is special in that _percepts_ are part of its subject
  matter. This is the essence of qualia.

  machines?"

# Folk Cartesianism

* We are all "folk Cartesians".

# Zombie hunch

* "Neural correlates" is a bad meme. A common intuition is that any
  representation which encodes information gives rise to a "phenomenal
  space". (Cf. neuronal workspace models, where information that is
  broadcast in a way that makes it widely available to many areas of
  processing is "conscious". Also Damasio's stuff. Also recent paper by
  Friston on consciousness.) Relatedly, the intuition behind inverted or
  absent qualia is that phenomenal character is independent of (parallel
  with) function.

* Zombies also have the hard problem to solve

* What if you were a zombie until 1s ago? What if you were a zombie for
  1s, then a non-zombie for 1s, and so on?

# Chalmers

* David Chalmers does an excellent job of spelling out the intuition
  that any scientific account of consciousness will _necessarily_ fall
  short of a full explanation. (This is what Joseph Levine famously
  called the "explanatory gap".) According to Chalmers, the best a
  scientific account can do is provide an explanation of the physical
  mechanisms that seem to _accompany_ consciousness -- the neural
  goings-on that correlate with conscious phenomena. For example
  [cite Dehaene] recent experiments have revealed differences in brain
  activity when we report a conscious percept versus when the same
  stimulus is presented to us in such a way that we are not conscious of
  it. Chalmer's intuition -- and it is such a compelling one that I
  think many share it -- is that _however much_ we discover about the
  difference in brain activity between conscious states and
  non-conscious ones, we make _no progress at all_ on understanding
  _why_ the conscious states actually involve consciousness. It seems
  that all the things conscious matter does can be done perfectly well
  without consciousness.

* Teed Rockwell described this stand-off between Dennett and Chalmers as
  "burden tennis". Each believes the burden of proof lies with the
  other. Dennett believes Chalmers has failed to show that there are any
  phenomena that remain to be accounted for, once all the behaviour is
  accounted for. Chalmers argues that Dennett must _either_ admit that
  the materialist story inherently falls short of a full explanation,
  _or_ why we have such a strong intuition that this is the case.

* Although the account of consciousness I want to develop here builds on
  Dennett's, I believe that in this particular respect Chalmers is
  right: the burden of proof does indeed lie with the _materialist_ to
  explain the "anti-materialist intuition". This is a challenge I want
  to tackle head-on.
