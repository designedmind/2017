REPRESENTING OURSELVES

Many feel that consciousness will require a new kind of science, perhaps one
which posits consciousness as an all-pervasive attribute of the universe. One
option is to _identify_ consciousness with some kind of general-purpose
information-processing or informational complexity, with no real insight into
why such an identification makes sense; another is to accept consciousness as
an emergent epiphenomenon, something that comes along for the ride whenever
information is processed in complex ways. These prospects relegate
consciousness to a passive role, serendipitous but otherwise useless, bereft
of specific features that distinguish it from information processing in
general.

Moreover, these perspectives neglect the distinct role that consciousness
plays in our behaviour. Human beings have a rich set of consciousness-related
capabilities: they can describe the world _from a vantage point_, contrast how
things _seem_ from that vantage point with how they believe the world to be,
summarise their goals and plans, explain the world around them in terms of
possibilities for action, and justify the actions they take in terms of
consciously held beliefs, desires and feelings. While we intuit strongly that
these things could somehow happen without &ldquo;the light being on&rdquo;
inside, we remain curiously oblivious to the fact that this feature of our
phenotype &mdash; elaborate behaviour oriented around an ostensibly private
mental life &mdash; is driven by psychological mechanisms taking place in the
physical world.

_These behaviours_ are the proper target, or explanandum, of a science of
consciousness. It is our _belief_ in the Hard Problem which needs to be taken
seriously, not the Hard Problem itself. What we intuit as a &ldquo;private
realm&rdquo; is a functional mechanism operating in the public world: a
brain's behavioural interface to the environment, designed by evolution to
enable new levels of autonomy, self-monitoring and deliberative action.

This perspective on consciousness seems radical at first, but a growing body
of evidence shows it to be capable of reconciling the scientific image with
our naive self-image. By representing not only the world and its affordances
for action, but also _ourselves_ as embodied agents in the world, and
ultimately ourselves _as representers_, the evolving brain converged on the
_self_ as the solution to a control problem. We cannot easily appreciate the
world-model as a model, because &ldquo;we&rdquo; only exist in virtue of the
model, as its central feature.

POSSIBLE THEMES AND TOPICS

The symposium is a forum to elaborate, discuss and critique this emerging
scientific picture of consciousness as functional mechanism. We invite
perspectives from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and informatics. The
following list of topics is not meant to constrain, but merely to highlight
areas where we feel there are important issues or opportunities to make
progress:

* **Confronting the &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; intuition.** The further-fact
  intuition is so compelling that many hold it be self-evident. It underlies
  not only David Chalmer's so-called Hard Problem, but also the plausibility
  of philosophical zombies and inverted spectra. Yet according to the
  functionalist view, it is false. A challenge for the functionalist story
  then is to explain _why_ it seems so obvious that consciousness is something
  non-functional, if it is precisely the opposite.
 
* **Brain homologies and animal consciousness.** Brain structures implicated
  in consciousness in humans evolved tens of millions of years ago. Many
  neuroscientists have argued that we will find (primitives forms of)
  consciousness wherever we find homologous structures. These claims seem to
  be in tension with accounts that associate consciousness with specific forms
  of autonomy and behavioural flexibility. Do they risk being too liberal?

* **Role of language.** If homology arguments can seem overly liberal,
  behavioural accounts risk being overly conservative, in linking
  consciousness to self-reports and inevitably to language. Nevertheless, in
  the animal kingdom, the human behavioural phenotype is uniquely flexible.
  What evidence is there relating the evolution of consciousness to the
  evolution of language and to this enhanced flexibility? Michael Arbib for
  example has argued that consciousness evolved in part to explicitly
  represent and communicate précis of intended behaviour.

* **Consciousness and free will.** According to Daniel Dennett, consciousness
  is an evolutionary innovation that situates a virtual agent at the narrative
  centre of a world of possibilities which can be assessed and compared with
  explicitly considered goals. This suggests a deep connection to free will:
  by allowing an agent to act _deliberatively_, consciousness enables
  _deliberate_ action, action that is imagined and evaluated before it takes
  place and assessed and re-evaluated after it has taken place. Is it possible
  to be conscious and not free in this sense?

* **Consciousness as meta-representation.** Björn Merker and others have
  argued that it is enough to have a unified world representation to have
  phenomenal consciousness, suggesting that (primitive) consciousness is
  evolutionarily ancient. Others claim that phenomenal consciousness
  necessarily involves _meta-representation_, reflective modelling of our own
  perceptual representations. Again, from the behavioural/functional
  perspective, the former risks being overly liberal. What would decide
  between these two possibilities?

* **Cartesian functionalism.** Dennett has been an outspoken critic of
  &ldquo;Cartesian materialism&rdquo;, the idea that everything &ldquo;comes
  together&rdquo; for consciousness in some kind of internal re-presentation.
  A key question for functionalism is deciding which parts of the Cartesian
  image are to to be discarded and which retained as valid components of a
  plausible folk theory or mature neuroscience of consciousness.

* **Programming conscious machines.** A mechanistic theory of consciousness
  is, by definition, something which can be implemented. This raises the
  prospect of testing theories of consciousness through implementation.
  Conversely, what can theories of consciousness tell us about how to
  implement conscious machines?

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of high-quality short papers for presentation at the
symposium. Papers should be in PDF format and no more than 4,000 words in
length. Please prepare your submission for blind review and submit via
EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dm2017. Authors of
accepted papers will have their registration fees waived.

After the symposium, there will be an open call for full-length papers for
publication as a collected volume or journal special issue (details
forthcoming).
