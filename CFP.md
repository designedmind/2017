REPRESENTING OURSELVES

When we consider our own minds, we seem privy to our own consciousness in a
way that no-one else can be. Consciousness seems to be a fact about me in
addition to all the functional facts about me. It seems quite plausible that a
machine with identical functionality could nevertheless have no &ldquo;light
on&rdquo; inside. These (compelling) intuitions lead many to the conclusion
that understanding consciousness will require a new kind of science. Some
propose identifying consciousness with general-purpose information-processing
of a certain complexity, but offer no insight into why such an identification
makes sense. Others construe consciousness as an emergent epiphenomenon, but
again offer no reason for thinking such a thing should emerge, beyond the fact
that it accords with the further-fact intuition.
 
The basic problem with these perspectives is that they relegate consciousness
to a passive role, with little to do except come along for the ride. This
neglects the extent to which consciousness the subject matter of much of what
we say and do: we can describe the world _from a vantage point_, contrast how
things _seem_ from that vantage point with how we believe the world to be,
summarise our goals and plans, explain the world around us in terms of
possibilities for action, and justify the actions we take in terms of
consciously held beliefs, desires and feelings. While we intuit strongly that
these things could somehow happen without &ldquo;real&rdquo; consciousness
inside, we remain curiously oblivious to the fact that if we are able to talk
about consciousness at all, then can only be a psychological mechanism taking
place in the physical world.

It is this feature of our phenotype &mdash; elaborate behaviour oriented
around an ostensibly private mental life &mdash; that is the proper target, or
explanandum, of a science of consciousness. Our _belief_ in the so-called Hard
Problem needs to be taken seriously, but not the Hard Problem itself. Modern
theories along these lines, developed by Daniel Dennett and others, propose
that we understand consciousness as the _content_ of an internal self-model.
What we intuit as a &ldquo;private realm&rdquo; is functionality operating in
the public world: a brain's behavioural interface to the environment, designed
by evolution to enable new levels of autonomy, self-monitoring and
deliberative action.

This perspective on consciousness seems radical at first, but a growing body
of evidence shows it to be capable of reconciling the scientific image with
our naive self-image. By representing not only the world and its affordances
for action, but also _ourselves_ as embodied agents in the world, and
ultimately ourselves _as representers_, the evolving brain converged on the
_self_ as the solution to a control problem. We cannot easily appreciate the
self-model-within-a-world-model _as_ a model, because &ldquo;we&rdquo; only
exist in virtue of the model, as its central feature.

The symposium is a forum to elaborate, discuss and critique this emerging
scientific picture of consciousness as a form of reflective behaviour. We
invite perspectives from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and informatics.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of high-quality short papers for presentation at the
symposium. Papers should be in PDF format and no more than 4,000 words in
length. Please prepare your submission for blind review and submit via
EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dm2017. Authors of
accepted papers will have their registration fees waived.

After the symposium, there will be an open call for full-length (8,000 word)
papers for publication as a collected volume or journal special issue (details
forthcoming).
