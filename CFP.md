REPRESENTING OURSELVES

Consciousness is often held to be so mysterious that a theory of it will
require a new kind of science, perhaps one which posits consciousness as an
all-pervasive feature of the universe. We may have to content ourselves with
_identifying_ consciousness with some kind of general-purpose
information-processing or informational complexity, with no real insight into
why such an identification makes sense, or accept consciousness as an emergent
epiphenomenon, something that comes along for the ride whenever information is
processed in complex ways. This relegates consciousness to a rather passive
role, serendipitous but otherwise useless, free of specifics that distinguish
it from any other kind of information processing that occurs in the biological
world.

This is a compelling intuition, but neglects the distinct role that
consciousness plays in our behaviour. Human beings have a rich set of
consciousness-related capabilities: they can describe the world _from a
vantage point_, report on how things _seem_ from that vantage point, summarise
their goals and plans, explain the world around them in terms of possibilities
for action, and justify the actions they take in terms of consciously held
beliefs, desires and feelings. Rather than arising as a mysterious side-effect
of information processing, such "consciousness-talk" - elaborate behaviour
oriented around an ostensibly private mental life - is a collection of
specific psychological mechanisms. These mechanisms seem to be related to our
ability to exploit contingent, often social, information in improvised
behavior tailored to local conditions, an adaptive mode that evolutionary
psychologists John Tooby and Irven DeVore labelled the "cognitive niche".

The aim of this symposium is to gather researchers who agree that _these
behaviours_ are the proper target, or explanandum, of a science of
consciousness. What seems (from the inside) to be a "private realm" is a
functional mechanism that exists in the public world: a brain's behavioural
interface to the world, designed by evolution to enable new levels of
autonomy, self-monitoring and deliberative action. By representing not only
the world and its affordances for action, but also _ourselves_ as embodied
agents in the world, and ultimately ourselves _as representers_, the evolving
brain converged on the _self_ as the solution to a control problem. As Thomas
Metzinger has noted we cannot easily appreciate the world-model as a model,
because "we" only exist in virtue of the model, as its central feature.

THEMES AND TOPICS

Above, we contrasted two methodological approaches to consciousness.
_Phenomenology-first_ takes at face value our intuition that consciousness is
a &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; that transcends mere behaviour. _Behaviour-first_
treats consciousness as a specific set of behavioural capabilities, a
repertoire that _includes_ my insistence that consciousness transcends mere
behaviour.

* **Explaining the &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; intuition.**

* **Role of language.** An argument from homology is often used to make the
  case for animal consciousness. Certain patterns of neuronal activation are
  correlated with consciousness in people, and the brain structures involved
  have homologues that are tens of millions of years old, so a reasonable
  inference seems to be that consciousness is that old. The behavioural
  perspective suggests caution here: unless an organism exhibits the specific
  capabilities associated with consciousness, we should be cautious in
  ascribing consciousness, regardless of homology. Michael Arbib for example
  has argued that consciousness evolved in part to explicitly represent and
  communicate précis of intended behaviour. These arguments get more subtle in
  the cases of humans who were not exposed to language during the crucial
  developmental window or who suffer from &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; syndrome,
  conscious but unable to outwardly behave.

* **Consciousness as meta-representation.** Metzinger, Merker and others have
  argued that it is enough to have a unified world representation to have
  phenomenal consciousness. Ramachandran suggests that phenomenal
  consciousness is meta-representation, reflective modelling of our own
  perceptual representations.

* **Consciousness and free will.** Metzinger calls consciousness a
  "behavioural space", echoing Ryle's idea of mental states as dispositional
  complexes.

* **Cartesian functionalism.** Dennett has been an outspoken critic of
  &ldquo;Cartesian materialism&rdquo;, the idea that there is a specific place
  in the brain where everything comes together for consciousness. Others,
  notably Baars, have argued that most modern theories of consciousness are
  &ldquo;theatre models&rdquo;. Even Dennett concedes &ldquo;vivid fossil
  traces&rdquo; of the Cartesian world view, and Metzinger has called his
  phenomenal self-model &ldquo;quasi-Cartesian&rdquo;.

* **Programming conscious machines.** A mechanistic theory of consciousness
  is, by definition, something which can be implemented. This raises the
  prospect of testing theories of consciousness by implementing them.
