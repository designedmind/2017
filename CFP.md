REPRESENTING OURSELVES

A pervasive assumption, held by scientists and non-scientists alike, is that
consciousness is so distinct and mysterious that understanding it
scientifically will require a new _kind_ of scientific explanation: either we
will need to admit consciousness as a new, all-pervasive primitive phenomenon
in the world, or content ourselves with _identifying_ consciousness with some
kind of general-purpose information-processing, with no real insight into why
such an identification makes sense. This starting point relegates
consciousness to a rather passive role, serendipitous but otherwise useless,
is free of specifics that distinguish it from any other kind of information
processing that occurs in the biological world.

This is a compelling intuition, but conspicuously neglects the distinct role
that consciousness plays in our overt behaviour. Human beings have a rich set
of consciousness-related capabilities: they can describe the world _from a
vantage point_, report on how things _seem_ from that vantage point, summarise
their goals and plans, explain the world around them in terms of possibilities
for action, and justify the actions they take in terms of consciously held
beliefs, desires and feelings. Rather than arising as a mysterious side-effect
of being an information processing system, such "consciousness-talk" -
elaborate behaviour oriented around an ostensibly private mental life - is a
set of specific psychological mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the
exploitation of contingent, often social, information in improvised behavior
tailored to local conditions, an adaptive mode that evolutionary psychologists
John Tooby and Irven DeVore labelled the "cognitive niche". Michael Arbib for
example has argued that consciousness evolved in part to explicitly represent
and communicate précis of intended behaviour.

The aim of this symposium is to gather researchers who agree that _these
behaviours_ are the proper target, or explanandum, of a science of
consciousness. What seems (from the inside) to be a "private realm" is a
functional mechanism that exists in the public world: an internal behavioural
interface to the world, designed by evolution to enable new levels of
autonomy, self-monitoring and deliberative action. By representing not only
the world and its affordances for action, but also _ourselves_ as embodied
agents in the world. As Thomas Metzinger has noted, the world-model is
"transparent" to us: we cannot easily appreciate it as a model. Indeed, "we"
only exist in virtue of the model, as its central feature.

Mention: Ryle, Dennett, Graziano, Ramanchandran, Hohwy, Merker, Cosmides

AFFILIATED WORKSHOP 

The symposium will be followed by Expecting Ourselves: Prediction, Action, and
the Embodied Mind, also in the Informatics Forum. Registration will be
