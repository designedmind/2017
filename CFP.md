REPRESENTING OURSELVES

Consciousness is often presumed to require a new kind of science, perhaps one
which posits consciousness as an all-pervasive feature of the universe. Two
popular options seem to be _identifying_ consciousness with some kind of
general-purpose information-processing or informational complexity, with no
real insight into why such an identification makes sense, or accepting
consciousness as an emergent epiphenomenon, something that comes along for the
ride whenever information is processed in complex ways. These prospects
relegate consciousness to a rather passive role, serendipitous but otherwise
useless, bereft of specific features that distinguish it from information
processing in general.

This is a powerful intuition, but neglects the distinct role that
consciousness plays in our behaviour. Human beings have a rich set of
consciousness-related capabilities: they can describe the world _from a
vantage point_, contrast how things _seem_ from that vantage point with how
they believe the world to be, summarise their goals and plans, explain the
world around them in terms of possibilities for action, and justify the
actions they take in terms of consciously held beliefs, desires and feelings.
While we intuit strongly that these things could somehow happen without "the
light being on" inside, we remain curiously oblivious to the fact that these
features of our phenotype -- elaborate behaviour oriented around an ostensibly
private mental life -- are being driven by psychological mechanisms taking
place in the physical world.

_These behaviours_ are the proper target, or explanandum, of a science of
consciousness. What we intuit as a "private realm" is a functional mechanism
operating in the public world: a brain's behavioural interface to the
environment, designed by evolution to enable new levels of autonomy,
self-monitoring and deliberative action. It is our _belief_ in the Hard
Problem which needs to be taken seriously, not the Hard Problem itself.

This perspective on consciousness is unintuitive at first, but a growing body
of evidence shows consciousness to be an evolved control mechanism. By
representing not only the world and its affordances for action, but also
_ourselves_ as embodied agents in the world, and ultimately ourselves _as
representers_, the evolving brain converged on the _self_ as the solution to a
control problem. We cannot easily appreciate the world-model as a model,
because "we" only exist in virtue of the model, as its central feature.

The workshop is a forum to elaborate, discuss and critique this emerging
scientific picture of consciousness as functional mechanism. We invite
perspectives from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and informatics.

POSSIBLE THEMES AND TOPICS

These are not meant to constrain, but merely to highlight areas where we feel
there are opportunities to make progress, especially where there is a tension
between the emerging behavioural/functional picture, and our deeply-held
intuitions.

* **Confronting the &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; intuition.** The further-fact
  intuition is so compelling that many hold it be self-evident. It underlies
  not only David Chalmer's so-called Hard Problem, but also the plausibility
  of philosophical zombies and inverted spectra. Yet according to the
  functionalist view, it is false. A challenge for the functionalist story
  then is to explain _why_ it seems so obvious that consciousness is something
  non-functional, if it is precisely the opposite.
 
* **Brain homologies and animal consciousness.** Brain structures implicated
  in consciousness in humans evolved tens of millions of years ago. Many
  neuroscientists have argued that we will find (primitives forms of)
  consciousness wherever we find homologous structures. These claims seem in
  tension with accounts that associate consciousness with specific forms of
  autonomy and behavioural flexibility. Are they too liberal?

* **Role of language.** If homology arguments can seem overly liberal,
  behavioural accounts risk being overly conservative, in linking
  consciousness to self-reports and inevitably to language. Nevertheless, in
  the animal kingdom, the human behavioural phenotype is uniquely flexible and
  it seems plausible that the evolution of consciousness and the evolution of
  language are tied both with each other and with this enhanced flexibility.
  Michael Arbib for example has argued that consciousness evolved in part to
  explicitly represent and communicate précis of intended behaviour.

* **Consciousness and free will.** According to Daniel Dennett, consciousness
  is an evolutionary innovation that situates a virtual agent at the narrative
  centre of a world of possibilities which can be assessed and compared with
  explicitly considered goals. This suggests a deep connection to free will:
  by allowing an agent to act _deliberatively_, consciousness enables
  _deliberate_ action, action that is imagined and evaluated before it takes
  place and assessed and re-evaluated after it has taken place. Is it possible
  to be conscious and not free in this sense?

* **Consciousness as meta-representation.** Björn Merker and others have
  argued that it is enough to have a unified world representation to have
  phenomenal consciousness, suggesting that (primitive) consciousness is
  evolutionarily ancient. Others, including V.S. Ramachandran, suggest that
  phenomenal consciousness necessarily involves _meta-representation_,
  reflective modelling of our own perceptual representations.

* **Cartesian functionalism.** Dennett has been an outspoken critic of
  &ldquo;Cartesian materialism&rdquo;, the idea that everything "comes
  together" for consciousness as some kind of internal re-presentation. A key
  question for functionalism is deciding which parts of the Cartesian image
  are to to be discarded and which retained as valid components of a plausible
  folk theory or mature neuroscience of consciousness.

* **Programming conscious machines.** A mechanistic theory of consciousness
  is, by definition, something which can be implemented. This raises the
  prospect of testing theories of consciousness through implementation.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of high-quality short papers for presentation at the
symposium. Papers should be in PDF format and no more than 4,000 words in
length. Please prepare your submission for blind review and submit via
EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dm2017. Authors of
accepted papers will have their registration fees waived.

After the symposium, there will be an open call for full-length papers for
publication as a collected volume or journal special issue (details
forthcoming).
