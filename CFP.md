REPRESENTING OURSELVES

The fact that I have subjective experience is quite mysterious. It seems to be
a &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; about me, surplus to all the conceivable
functional facts. I can imagine a machine with the same outward behaviour, yet
lacking an inner life. These intuitions are compelling, and lead many to
conclude that a theory of consciousness will require a new kind of science,
perhaps one which posits consciousness as an all-pervasive feature of the
universe. We may have to content ourselves with identifying consciousness with
some kind of general-purpose information processing or informational
complexity, with no real insight into why such an identification makes sense,
or accept consciousness as an epiphenomenon, present whenever certain kinds of
processes are present. These offer little in the way of explanation, and
relegate consciousness to a passive role, with little to do except come along
for the ride.

These intuitions also neglect a crucial fact about our behaviour, namely that
consciousness is much of the _subject matter_ of what we say and do. We
describe the world _from a vantage point_, contrast how things _seem_ from
that vantage point with how we believe the world to be, summarise our goals
and plans, explain the world around us in terms of possibilities for action,
and justify the actions we take in terms of consciously held beliefs, desires
and feelings. While we intuit strongly that such &ldquo;consciousness
talk&rdquo; &mdash; elaborate behaviour oriented around an ostensibly private
mental life &mdash; could somehow happen without &ldquo;real&rdquo;
consciousness inside, we remain curiously oblivious to the fact that if _our_
consciousness talk is ever to be about _our_ consciousness then it can only be
that the latter is a functional mechanism taking place in the physical world.

It is therefore these behaviours that are the proper target, or explanandum,
of a science of consciousness. Modern theories along these lines, developed by
Daniel Dennett and others, propose that we understand our conscious lives as
the _content_ of an internal self-model. What we intuit as a &ldquo;private
realm&rdquo; is a control mechanism operating in the public world: a brain's
way of representing the organism as an embodied agent, a reflective
self-representation designed by evolution to enable new levels of autonomy,
self-monitoring and deliberative action. By representing not only the world
and its affordances for action, but also ourselves as embodied agents in the
world, and ultimately ourselves as _representers_, the evolving brain
converged on the _self_ as the solution to a control problem. We cannot easily
appreciate the self-model-within-a-world-model _as_ a model, because
&ldquo;we&rdquo; only exist in virtue of the model, as its central feature.

The symposium is a forum to elaborate, discuss and critique this emerging
scientific picture of consciousness as a form of reflective behaviour. We
invite perspectives from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and informatics.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of high-quality short papers for presentation at the
symposium. Papers should be in PDF format and no more than 4,000 words in
length. Please prepare your submission for blind review and submit via
EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dm2017. Authors of
accepted papers will have their registration fees waived.

After the symposium, there will be an open call for full-length (8,000 word)
papers for publication as a collected volume or journal special issue (details
forthcoming).
