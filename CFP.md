REPRESENTING OURSELVES

When we consider our own minds, we seem privy to our own consciousness in a
special way. My own consciousness seems to be a &ldquo;further fact&rdquo;
about me, surplus to all the functional facts; it seems quite plausible that a
machine with identical functionality could nevertheless have no &ldquo;light
on&rdquo; inside. These intuitions are compelling, and lead many to the
conclusion that understanding consciousness will require a new kind of
science. Some propose identifying consciousness with information-processing of
a certain complexity, but offer no insight into why such an identification
makes sense. Others construe consciousness as an emergent epiphenomenon, but
again offer no reason for thinking such a thing should emerge. These ideas
speak to our intuitions, but offer little in the way of explanation.
 
The basic problem with the way we intuit our own consciousness is that we tend
to see it in a passive role, with little to do except come along for the ride.
This neglects the extent to which consciousness is the _subject matter_ of
much of what we say and do: we can describe the world _from a vantage point_,
contrast how things _seem_ from that vantage point with how we believe the
world to be, summarise our goals and plans, explain the world around us in
terms of possibilities for action, and justify the actions we take in terms of
consciously held beliefs, desires and feelings. While we intuit strongly that
these things could somehow happen without &ldquo;real&rdquo; consciousness
inside, we remain curiously oblivious to the fact that if we are able to talk
about consciousness at all, then can only be a psychological mechanism taking
place in the physical world.

It is therefore this feature of our phenotype &mdash; elaborate behaviour
oriented around an ostensibly private mental life &mdash; that is the proper
target, or explanandum, of a science of consciousness. It is our _belief_ in
the so-called Hard Problem which needs to be taken seriously, rather than the
Hard Problem itself. Modern theories along these lines, developed by Daniel
Dennett and others, propose that we understand our conscious lives as the
_content_ of an internal self-model. What we intuit as a &ldquo;private
realm&rdquo; is a special kind of functionality operating in the public world:
a brain's way of representing the organism as an embodied agent, a reflective
mechanism designed by evolution to enable new levels of autonomy,
self-monitoring and deliberative action.

This perspective on consciousness seems radical at first, but a growing body
of evidence shows it to be capable of explaining our intuitions about
ourselves, without necessarily taking them all at face value. By representing
not only the world and its affordances for action, but also _ourselves_ as
embodied agents in the world, and ultimately ourselves _as representers_, the
evolving brain converged on the _self_ as the solution to a control problem.
We cannot easily appreciate the self-model-within-a-world-model _as_ a model,
because &ldquo;we&rdquo; only exist in virtue of the model, as its central
feature.

The symposium is a forum to elaborate, discuss and critique this emerging
scientific picture of consciousness as a form of reflective behaviour. We
invite perspectives from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and informatics.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of high-quality short papers for presentation at the
symposium. Papers should be in PDF format and no more than 4,000 words in
length. Please prepare your submission for blind review and submit via
EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dm2017. Authors of
accepted papers will have their registration fees waived.

After the symposium, there will be an open call for full-length (8,000 word)
papers for publication as a collected volume or journal special issue (details
forthcoming).
