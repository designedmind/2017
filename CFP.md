REPRESENTING OURSELVES

A commonly held intuition in the science of consciousness is that ..
Consciousness is simply identical to this formal property and has no specifics
that distinguish it from any other kind of information processing that occurs
in the biological world.

This is in stark contrast to the consciousness-related behaviours that people
actually exhibit. Conscious beings have a rich set of behaviours centered
around consciousness: they can describe the world _from a vantage point_,
report on how things _seem_ from that vantage point, summarise their goals and
actions, explain the world around them in terms of possibilities for action,
and justify those actions in terms of consciously held beliefs, desires and
feelings. Such "consciousness-talk" - elaborate behaviour about our private
mental lives - is driven by psychological processes whose

The aim of this symposium is to gather researchers who agree that _these
behaviours_ are the proper target, or explanandum, of a science of
consciousness. What seems (from the inside) to be a "private realm" is a
functional mechanism that exists in the public world: an internal behavioural
interface to the world, designed by evolution to enable new levels of
autonomy, self-monitoring and deliberative action.
