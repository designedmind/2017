REPRESENTING OURSELVES

Consciousness is often held to be so mysterious that a theory of it will
require a new kind of science, perhaps one which posits consciousness as an
all-pervasive feature of the universe. We may have to content ourselves with
_identifying_ consciousness with some kind of general-purpose
information-processing or informational complexity, with no real insight into
why such an identification makes sense, or accept consciousness as an emergent
epiphenomenon, something that comes along for the ride whenever information is
processed in complex ways. These relegate consciousness to a rather passive
role, serendipitous but otherwise useless, free of specifics that distinguish
it from any other kind of information processing that occurs in the biological
world.

This is a powerful intuition, but neglects the distinct role that
consciousness plays in our behaviour. Human beings have a rich set of
consciousness-related capabilities: they can describe the world _from a
vantage point_, contrast how things _seem_ from that vantage point with how
they believe the world to be, summarise their goals and plans, explain the
world around them in terms of possibilities for action, and justify the
actions they take in terms of consciously held beliefs, desires and feelings.
Rather than arising as a mysterious side-effect of information processing,
such &ldquo;consciousness-talk&rdquo; - elaborate behaviour oriented around an
ostensibly private mental life - is a collection of specific psychological
mechanisms. These mechanisms seem to be related to our ability to exploit
contingent, often social, information in improvised behavior tailored to local
conditions, an adaptive mode that evolutionary psychologists John Tooby and
Irven DeVore labelled the "cognitive niche".

The aim of this symposium is to gather researchers who agree that it is _these
behaviours_ that are the proper target, or explanandum, of a science of
consciousness. What we intuit as a "private realm" is a functional mechanism
operating in the public world: a brain's behavioural interface to the
environment, designed by evolution to enable new levels of autonomy,
self-monitoring and deliberative action. By representing not only the world
and its affordances for action, but also _ourselves_ as embodied agents in the
world, and ultimately ourselves _as representers_, the evolving brain
converged on the _self_ as the solution to a control problem. We cannot easily
appreciate the world-model as a model, because "we" only exist in virtue of
the model, as its central feature.

THEMES AND TOPICS

Above, we contrasted two methodological starting points. _Phenomenology-first_
takes the &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; intuition at face value, treating
consciousness as an _additional thing_ that accompanies &ldquo;mere&rdquo;
behaviour. _Behaviour-first_ &mdash; what Daniel Dennett has called
&ldquo;heterophenomenology&rdquo; &mdash; treats consciousness as a specific
set of behavioural capabilities, a repertoire that _includes_ my tendency to
insist that my consciousness amounts to more than mere behaviour.
Phenomenology-first takes the Hard Problem seriously; behaviour-first takes
our _belief_ in the Hard Problem seriously, but not the Hard Problem itself.

A key goal of the symposium is to build more consensus around behaviour-first
as the only sound basis for a science of consciousness. Suitable topics
include, but are not in any way limited to:

* **Confronting the &ldquo;further fact&rdquo; intuition.** The further-fact
  intuition is so compelling that many hold it be self-evident. It underlies
  not only David Chalmer's so-called Hard Problem, but also the plausibility
  of philosophical zombies and inverted spectra, Frank Jackson's
  &ldquo;Knowledge Argument&rdquo;, Rodolfo Llinás view of the role of
  thalamocortical oscillations, and Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information
  Theory. Yet according to the functionalist view, it is false. A challenge
  for the functionalist story then is to explain _why_ it seems so obvious
  that consciousness is something non-functional, if it is precisely the
  opposite.
 
* **Brain homologies and animal consciousness.** Brain structures implicated
  in consciousness in humans evolved tens of millions of years ago. Many
  neuroscientists have argued that we will find (primitives forms of)
  consciousness wherever we find homologous structures. The behavioural
  perspective suggests caution here: unless an organism exhibits the specific
  capabilities associated with consciousness, we should be wary of ascribing
  consciousness, even in the presence of obvious clohomologies.

* **Role of language.** If homology arguments can be overly liberal,
  behavioural accounts risk being overly conservative, in linking
  consciousness to self-reports and inevitably to language. Nevertheless, in
  the animal kingdom, the human behavioural phenotype is uniquely flexible and
  it seems plausible that the evolution of consciousness and the evolution of
  language are tied both with each other and with this enhanced flexibility.
  Michael Arbib for example has argued that consciousness evolved in part to
  explicitly represent and communicate précis of intended behaviour. Tying
  consciousness to language is problematic in the cases of humans who were not
  exposed to language during the crucial developmental window or who suffer
  from &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; syndrome, conscious but unable to outwardly
  behave.

* **Consciousness and free will.** Thomas Metzinger describes consciousness as
  as a &ldquo;behavioural space&rdquo;, an idea reminiscent of Gilbert Ryle's
  dispositional view of mental states. According to Daniel Dennett,
  consciousness is an evolutionary innovation that situates a virtual agent at
  the narrative centre of a world of possibilities which can be assessed and
  compared with explicitly considered goals. This suggests a deep connection
  to free will: by allowing an agent to act _deliberatively_, consciousness
  enables _deliberate_ action, action that is imagined and evaluated before it
  takes place and assessed and re-evaluated after it has taken place.

* **Consciousness as meta-representation.** Björn Merker and others have
  argued that it is enough to have a unified world representation to have
  phenomenal consciousness, suggesting that (primitive) consciousness is
  evolutionarily ancient. Others suggest that phenomenal consciousness
  necessarily involves _meta-representation_, reflective modelling of our own
  perceptual representations.

* **Cartesian functionalism.** Dennett has been an outspoken critic of
  &ldquo;Cartesian materialism&rdquo;, the idea that everything "comes
  together" for consciousness as some kind of internal re-presentation. A key
  question for functionalism is deciding which parts of the Cartesian image
  are to to be discarded and which retained as valid components of a plausible
  folk theory or mature neuroscience of consciousness.

* **Programming conscious machines.** A mechanistic theory of consciousness
  is, by definition, something which can be implemented. This raises the
  prospect of testing theories of consciousness through implementation.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of high-quality short papers for presentation at the
symposium. Papers should be in PDF format and no more than 4,000 words in
length. Please prepare your submission for blind review and submit via
EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dm2017. Authors of
accepted papers will have their registration fees waived.

After the symposium, there will be an open call for full-length papers for
publication as a collected volume or journal special issue (details
forthcoming).
