REPRESENTING OURSELVES

Consciousness is often held to be so distinct a phenomenon that a theory of it
will require a new kind of science, perhaps one which posits consciousness as
an all-pervasive primitive feature of the universe. At best, we will have to
content ourselves with _identifying_ consciousness with some kind of
general-purpose information-processing, with no real insight into why such an
identification makes sense. This relegates consciousness to a rather passive
role, serendipitous but otherwise useless, free of specifics that distinguish
it from any other kind of information processing that occurs in the biological
world.

This is a compelling intuition, but neglects the distinct role that
consciousness plays in our behaviour. Human beings have a rich set of
consciousness-related capabilities: they can describe the world _from a
vantage point_, report on how things _seem_ from that vantage point, summarise
their goals and plans, explain the world around them in terms of possibilities
for action, and justify the actions they take in terms of consciously held
beliefs, desires and feelings. Rather than arising as a mysterious side-effect
of being an information processing system, such "consciousness-talk" -
elaborate behaviour oriented around an ostensibly private mental life - is a
set of specific psychological mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the
exploitation of contingent, often social, information in improvised behavior
tailored to local conditions, an adaptive mode that evolutionary psychologists
John Tooby and Irven DeVore labelled the "cognitive niche". Michael Arbib for
example has argued that consciousness evolved in part to explicitly represent
and communicate précis of intended behaviour.

The aim of this symposium is to gather researchers who agree that _these
behaviours_ are the proper target, or explanandum, of a science of
consciousness. What seems (from the inside) to be a "private realm" is a
functional mechanism that exists in the public world: a brain's behavioural
interface to the world, designed by evolution to enable new levels of
autonomy, self-monitoring and deliberative action. By representing not only
the world and its affordances for action, but also _ourselves_ as embodied
agents in the world, and ultimately ourselves _as representers_, the evolving
brain converged on the _self_ as the solution to a control problem. As Thomas
Metzinger has noted we cannot easily appreciate the world-model as a model,
because "we" only exist in virtue of the model, as its central feature.
