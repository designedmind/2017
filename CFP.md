REPRESENTING OURSELVES

Many feel that consciousness will require a new kind of science. One popular
move is to _identify_ consciousness with general-purpose
information-processing of a certain complexity. No insight is offered into why
such an identification makes sense, and consciousness is relegated to a
passive role, bereft of specific features that distinguish it from information
processing in general. Another, related intuition construes consciousness as
an emergent epiphenomenon, something that accompanies certain kinds of complex
behaviours. Again, this leaves consciousness in a passive role, with little to
do except come along for the ride.

The basic problem with these perspectives is that they neglect the distinct
functional role that consciousness plays in our behaviour. Human beings have a
rich set of consciousness-related capabilities: they can describe the world
_from a vantage point_, contrast how things _seem_ from that vantage point
with how they believe the world to be, summarise their goals and plans,
explain the world around them in terms of possibilities for action, and
justify the actions they take in terms of consciously held beliefs, desires
and feelings. We intuit strongly that these things could somehow happen
without &ldquo;real&rdquo; consciousness inside, yet remain curiously
oblivious to the fact that if we are able to talk about consciousness at all,
then it must be a psychological mechanism taking place in the physical world.

It is this feature of our phenotype &mdash; elaborate behaviour oriented
around an ostensibly private mental life &mdash; that is the proper target, or
explanandum, of a science of consciousness. Our _belief_ in the so-called Hard
Problem needs to be taken seriously, but not the Hard Problem itself. Modern
theories along these lines, developed by Daniel Dennett and others, propose
consciousness as a control mechanism. What we intuit as a &ldquo;private
realm&rdquo; is functionality operating in the public world: a brain's
behavioural interface to the environment, designed by evolution to enable new
levels of autonomy, self-monitoring and deliberative action.

This perspective on consciousness seems radical at first, but a growing body
of evidence shows it to be capable of reconciling the scientific image with
our naive self-image. By representing not only the world and its affordances
for action, but also _ourselves_ as embodied agents in the world, and
ultimately ourselves _as representers_, the evolving brain converged on the
_self_ as the solution to a control problem. We cannot easily appreciate the
world-model as a model, because &ldquo;we&rdquo; only exist in virtue of the
model, as its central feature.

The symposium is a forum to elaborate, discuss and critique this emerging
scientific picture of consciousness as functionality. We invite perspectives
from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and informatics.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of high-quality short papers for presentation at the
symposium. Papers should be in PDF format and no more than 4,000 words in
length. Please prepare your submission for blind review and submit via
EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dm2017. Authors of
accepted papers will have their registration fees waived.

After the symposium, there will be an open call for full-length (8,000 word)
papers for publication as a collected volume or journal special issue (details
forthcoming).
