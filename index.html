                <p><b>Informatics Forum &middot; University of Edinburgh &middot; 8 &amp; 9 November 2017</b></p>
                <p>Our intuition tells us that consciousness is a special non-physical realm, inhabited by thoughts and feelings. An emerging scientific picture reveals consciousness as an elaborate reflective capability, designed by evolution to give us a level of agency and self-monitoring that non-conscious beings lack. A rich internal narrative underwrites that capability: a virtual world which ascribes phenomenal properties &mdash; colours, tastes, feelings &mdash; to things and to ourselves.</p>
                <p>This two-day event brings together researchers working on all aspects of the science of consciousness, including philosophy of mind, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and artificial consciousness. The symposium will be followed by <a href="http://www.x-spect.org/first-project-workshop.html">Expecting Ourselves: Prediction, Action, and the Embodied Mind</a>, also in the Informatics Forum.

                <h2>Manifesto: <br>Phenomenology as Functionality</h2>
                <p>What are the <i>data to be explained</i> by a scientific theory of consciousness?</p>

                <p>Human beings report internal, subjective experience, taking
                place in a private realm only they can access. At face value,
                this presents a hard problem: how does the raw matter of our
                brains come to have subjectivity? Consciousness seems
                inherently non-functional, and we can never know with
                certainty whether another creature is &ldquo;really&rdquo;
                conscious. But although intuitively compelling, the
                non-functional view is conspicuously silent on the question of
                how conscious experience manages to be a robust feature of our
                overt behaviour, in the sense of being much of the
                &ldquo;subject matter&rdquo; of what we say and do.

                <p>A more scientifically grounded starting point is take our
                tendency to intuit consciousness in this way as <i>a key part
                of the data to be explained</i>. Why do our brains represent
                our <i>selves</i> as disembodied agents, inhabiting a material
                body and observing the world through its senses? What does
                this self-model allow us to do that we wouldn't be able to do
                otherwise? One possibility is precisely that it allows us to
                reflect on, talk about, and act deliberatively with respect to
                how the world &ldquo;seems&rdquo; from our point of view. From
                this viewpoint, phenomenal experience does not arise as a
                mysterious correlate of certain kinds of information
                processing in the brain, but is instead part of the
                <i>content</i> of an egocentric world-model that underlies
                self-reports and other &ldquo;me-oriented&rdquo; behaviour.

                  <br>James Blackmon (San Francisco State University)

                  <p align="left">Can we conceive of
                  philosophical zombies &mdash; that is, of beings physically identical
                  to us in both constitution and behavior but lacking
                  consciousness? An affirmative answer is taken by many to
                  support dualism. But what is this property that philosophical
                  zombies are supposed to lack? Is it a property that makes any
                  physical difference in our lives at all? Are we not physical
                  detectors of our own consciousness? And if we are, then how is
                  it that zombies can be our physical duplicates when they do
                  not act as we would act had we not been conscious, but as we
                  do act because we are conscious? I will argue that these
                  considerations show that the zombie arguments come at a
                  significant cost. </div>

                  <div id="demo-2"
                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">The question whether
                  subjective conscious experience is a mere gloss on the top of
                  a sophisticated bodily machinery designed to survive and
                  reproduce, or something more, has long-time fascinated both
                  philosophers and scientists. Self-consciousness, the feeling
                  that our experiences are bound to the self &mdash; as a unitary
                  entity, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; &mdash; is considered to be one of the most
                  astonishing features of the human mind. Famously philosophers
                  argue that it is possible to imagine a world in which my body
                  behaves in exactly the same manner I behave in this world, yet
                  without any subjective conscious experience inhabiting it. A
                  &ldquo;zombie&rdquo; me, so to speak (Chalmers 2006). In this paper we
                  will leave aside the ontological implications of these thought
                  experiments and focus instead on one basic yet overlooked
                  aspect of self-consciousness and perceptual experiences in
                  this particular world, i.e. the fact that human beings start
                  their journey into their experiential life within the body of
                  another experiencing subject. Indeed, not only do my
                  subjective experiences not occur in a vacuum &mdash; they are given
                  to me through my body &mdash; but more crucially, my bodily
                  experiences emerge from the outset within an other’s
                  experiencing body. We discuss some implications of this
                  overlooked relational and primitive aspect of our embodiment
                  on current debates on the nature of self-awareness. We focus
                  on touch as paradigmatic example of perceptual awareness, i.e.
                  as fundamental point of contact of an experiencing subject
                  with the external environment. We suggest that endorsing a
                  developmental perspective in addressing the nature of
                  subjective conscious experiences might shed additional light
                  on current debates on the relational nature of self-awareness
                  and ultimately consciousness itself. </div>

                  <p align="left"><b>The Radical Plasticity Thesis: Consciousness is something that the brain learns to do</b>
                  <br>Axel Cleeremans (Université Libre de Bruxelles)

                  <button class="collapse-button" data-toggle="collapse"
                  data-target="#demo-3">abstract</button> <div id="demo-3"
                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">Here, I explore the idea
                  that consciousness is something that the brain learns to do
                  rather than an intrinsic property of certain neural states and
                  not others. Starting from the idea that neural activity is
                  inherently unconscious, the question thus becomes: How does
                  the brain learn to be conscious? I suggest that consciousness
                  arises as a result of the brain&rsquo;s continuous attempts at
                  predicting not only the consequences of its actions on the
                  world and on other agents, but also the consequences of
                  activity in one cerebral region on activity in other regions.
                  By this account, the brain continuously and unconsciously
                  learns to redescribe its own activity to itself, so developing
                  systems of meta- representations that characterise and qualify
                  the target first-order representations. Such learned
                  redescriptions, enriched by the emotional value associated
                  with them, form the basis of conscious experience. Learning
                  and plasticity are thus central to consciousness, to the
                  extent that experiences only occur in experiencers that have
                  learned to know they possess certain first-order states and
                  that have learned to care more about certain states than about
                  others. This is what I call the &ldquo;Radical Plasticity Thesis&rdquo;.
                  In a sense thus, this is the enactive perspective, but turned
                  both inwards and (further) outwards. Consciousness involves
                  &ldquo;signal detection on the mind&rdquo; the conscious mind is the
                  brain&rsquo;s (non-conceptual, implicit) theory about itself. I
                  illustrate these ideas through neural network models that
                  simulate the relationships between performance and awareness
                  in different tasks.</div>

                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">Our aim in this paper is to
                  integrate Graziano&rsquo;s attentional schema theory into the
                  predictive processing framework, in order to resolve
                  deficiencies in both accounts. Whilst predictive processing is
                  able to offer a functional description of some aspects of
                  consciousness, it currently lacks a plausible explanation of
                  the subjective quality or the phenomenal &lsquo;feel&rsquo; of conscious
                  experience. The attentional schema theory explains this
                  &lsquo;mysterious&rsquo; quality of consciousness as an epiphenomenal
                  byproduct of the mechanism used to control top-down attention,
                  a story that we will argue is well suited to the predictive
                  framework. On the other hand, the attentional schema currently
                  lacks concrete details regarding the way it should be
                  formalized and implemented by neural processes. This weakens
                  the appeal of the attentional schema hypothesis as it lacks
                  the ability to predict how interventions on parts of the
                  cognitive mechanism underlying the schema will influence and
                  change conscious experience. The predictive processing
                  framework can provide an attractive and empirically tractable
                  way for filling in such detail. Once integrated, these two
                  accounts can offer a plausible explanation of the supposedly
                  irreducible and mysterious &lsquo;feel&rsquo; of conscious experience, in
                  terms of the attentional mechanisms responsible for

                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">Illusionism is the thesis
                  according to which phenomenal consciousness is an illusion: it
                  does not really exist, even though it introspectively seems to
                  exist. This thesis has many advantages; it notably strengthens
                  the physicalist view of the mind, as it avoids the difficult
                  task of trying to locate phenomenal consciousness in the
                  physical world. Illusionism has found some prominent defenders
                  amongst contemporary philosophers and scientists.

                  <p align="left">Here I will presuppose that illusionism is true: phenomenal
                  consciousness is an introspective illusion. We can then start
                  to wonder: what kind of illusion is it? I will focus on one
                  aspect of this question: is the illusion of phenomenality a
                  rich illusion or a sparse illusion? In a rich illusion, the
                  illusory object is &ldquo;positively&rdquo; presented with some inexistent
                  features; in a sparse illusion, the illusory object is
                  presented in an incomplete way, but not in a positively
                  incorrect way (that is, it is presented with no inexistent
                  features); however, the partial presentation of the object
                  then leads us to wrongly infer the presence of inexistent
                  features (and/or the absence of existent features).

                  <p align="left">I will first present illusionist theories of consciousness
                  (focusing on Dennett&rsquo;s and Graziano&rsquo;s). I will then explain
                  more precisely what I mean by &ldquo;rich&rdquo; and &ldquo;sparse&rdquo; illusions,
                  and I will show that the most popular illusionist views of
                  consciousness (including Dennett&rsquo;s and Graziano&rsquo;s) are
                  sparse-illusion accounts. I will then give an argument against
                  sparse-illusion accounts: I will try to show that they have
                  trouble accounting for our strong intuitive reluctance to
                  accept the truth of illusionism, and the purely
                  physico-functional nature of our internal states.</div>

                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">The fact that consciousness
                  is for guiding action comes out vividly when we reflect on our
                  conscious experience of opportunities for action, or
                  &lsquo;affordances&rsquo;. Properties like being catchable figure in our
                  experience precisely because sensitivity to such properties
                  helps us to engage with our environment. One of the most
                  striking features of these properties is that, strictly
                  speaking, they are neither properties of our environment nor
                  of ourselves. When the brain models an affordance it models a
                  relation between ourselves and the world. To see the ball as
                  catchable, for example, is to see it as standing in a certain
                  relation to your ability to catch. Reflecting on affordances
                  thus serves to show not just that consciousness serves to
                  guide action, but that it does so by modelling the self and
                  its place in the environment. Affordances have been the topic
                  of research in a wide range of disciplines. Although our
                  understanding of opportunities for action and their place in
                  conscious experience has been greatly improved by this
                  research, it faces a considerable limitation. Throughout the
                  considerable literature on affordances the afforded actions
                  that theorists discuss are, with only a few exceptions, bodily
                  actions such as gripping, walking or eating. This paper
                  presents the hypothesis that we are also sensitive to
                  affordances for mental actions such as attending, imagining
                  and calculating. I suggest that by expanding the scope of
                  affordances we will be in a better position to capture the
                  action-guiding function of consciousness, the full diversity
                  of conscious experience and the place of higher-cognitive
                  capacities in our self-models. Although this &lsquo;Mental
                  Affordance Hypothesis&rsquo; is ultimately answerable to the
                  empirical evidence, a variety of phenomenological and
                  theoretical considerations strongly suggest that we are
                  appropriately sensitive to opportunities for mental action.

                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">The sense of self or
                  self-awareness is perhaps the most difficult aspect of
                  conscious experience to account for in a naturalistic
                  framework. In recent years, however, new clinical and
                  experimental data from autoscopic phenomena and full-body
                  illusions have contributed to refine our understanding of
                  embodied aspects of selfhood. On the basis of these data, it
                  has been suggested that self-identification to a body,
                  self-location in space and the geometrical first-person
                  perspective are necessary and jointly sufficient for the
                  simplest form of self-consciousness, which has been labelled
                  &ldquo;minimal phenomenal selfhood&rdquo; (MPS). In this paper, I review
                  and criticize this hypothesis. Firstly, I summarize the
                  available evidence regarding autoscopic phenomena and
                  full-body illusions that led to the threefold distinction
                  between self-identification to a body, self-location and the
                  first-person perspective. Secondly, I argue that
                  self-identification to a body is not a necessary condition for
                  self-consciousness. Thirdly, I suggest that the notion of
                  &ldquo;first-person perspective&rdquo; is ambiguous and may refer to at
                  least two different aspects singled out by autoscopic
                  phenomena and full-body illusions, namely the experienced
                  origin point of one’s visual and auditory reference frames,
                  and one’s experienced orientation in absolute space. I
                  subsequently argue that neither of these aspects are necessary
                  for self-consciousness. Finally, I put forward a deflationary
                  account of minimal phenomenal selfhood according to which it
                  is reducible to the sense of spatial self-location. I suggest
                  that the sense of self-location often has two components that
                  are indistinguishable in ordinary conscious experience, but
                  can come apart in specific cases, without disrupting MPS.
                  However, there also appear to be conscious experiences in
                  which the lack of experienced self-location mediates a loss of
                  self-consciousness. I conclude by suggesting that the primacy
                  of experienced self-location for self-consciousness is
                  consistent with its evolutionary role for survival. For a
                  self-modelling system, being someone is first and foremost
                  being somewhere. </div>

                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">I explore the idea that
                  perceptual &ldquo;qualia&rdquo; (seemings, appearances) are
                  functional components of a reflexive model or theory that we
                  deploy of our own perceptual relationship to the world. On
                  this view human perceptual behaviour partitions into two
                  distinct tiers of capability: representing the world, and
                  representing ourselves in the act of representing the world.
                  The latter equips me with a rich set of subpersonal,
                  subsymbolic opinions about how the world appears from my
                  perceptual vantage point, allowing &ldquo;how things seem to
                  me&rdquo; to become part of the subject matter of my own
                  behaviour.

                  <p align="left">Why should we believe that
                  metarepresentational content of this kind is somehow
                  sufficient for, or constitutive of, phenomenal consciousness?
                  The claim is not that certain judgements made by the brain
                  somehow become conscious solely (yet inexplicably) in virtue
                  of being the object of another judgement. Rather, the
                  suggestion is that, because first-order percepts represent the
                  world, in a non-conscious way, from the perceptual vantage
                  point of the organism, the organism which entertains a
                  higher-order theory of those percepts entertains a theory of
                  how the world seems from its own point of view. That is the
                  subject matter of the theory. This second tier of theorisation
                  thus gives rise to an &ldquo;audience&rdquo;: not an inner
                  humunculus whose power of vision is the source of our power of
                  vision, but a virtual agent who can not only see but can
                  appreciate that it sees.</div>

                  major claims (cf. Prinz, 2017):
                  (i) Conscious awareness builds on self-representation, (ii)
                  selfhood is a social, not a natural kind, and (iii) selfhood
                  is imported from others to self. Classical import theories are
                  grossly underspecified. While various brands of export
                  theories offer mechanisms to account for the putative
                  transition from self to others, import theories have not much
                  to offer to account for the putative transition in the reverse
                  direction. This paper outlines a framework to close this gap.
                  Key to the framework is the notion of action matching. This
                  term addresses dyadic interactions for perception/production
                  matching, i.e. matching perception of foreign action to
                  production of own action and vice versa. The framework
                  specifies both representational resources and social practices

                  Processing accounts, the brain uses a generative model to
                  issue top-down hypotheses about the possible causes of sensory
                  input, compares these hypotheses with actual input and updates
                  its model accordingly until prediction error is minimized.
                  This bidirectional process operates on many levels of the
                  processing hierarchy. It is supposed to be the overarching
                  goal and unifying principle of the cognitive system to
                  minimize prediction error either by perceptual updating or by
                  acting upon the world to make the world match the hypothesis.

                  Consequently, what we experience is not the world, &ldquo;it is the
                  predictions of the currently best hypothesis about the world&rdquo;
                  (Hohwy 2013, p.~48). The claim that the brain generates a model
                  of the world and attempts to &ldquo;get it right&rdquo; by updating it
                  based on sensory feedback gives rise to the issue of accuracy
                  conditions for perceptual experience. This paper discusses the
                  specification of accuracy conditions within the predictive
                  processing framework. According to Recanati (2007), the
                  accuracy conditions are determined not only by content (Searle
                  1983), but also by intentional mode (perceiving, remembering
                  etc.). My perception of the tree in front of me is accurate if
                  there is a tree in front of me and I am causally interacting
                  with this particular tree right now. The accuracy condition is
                  different for my remembering a tree. In this way, the subject
                  may enter the specification of the accuracy condition in two
                  ways, in the subject-sense and the object-sense (Shoemaker
                  1968). If Recanati is right, then in what way does the subject
                  enter the accuracy conditions and how should this be captured
                  in the predictive coding framework? We discuss various
                  proposals from the recent literature, including the way
                  self-models (Metzinger 2003) may help to address this
                  point.</div>

                  class="collapse"> <p align="left">This paper sketches an
                  account that explains the apparent, but elusive, subjective
                  quality of &ldquo;substantiality&rdquo; of the phenomenal self. It
                  integrates two recent predictive processing accounts of the
                  self with key ideas of Michael Graziano’s attention schema
                  theory of consciousness. Similarly to attention schema theory,
                  the present account posits an internal model of ongoing
                  attentional processing that supports attentional control. In
                  terms of predictive processing, it is a dynamic model of
                  precision estimates that represents the salience of features,
                  objects, and internal and external processes. The apparent
                  substantiality of the self is then explained by a structural
                  feature of this salience model: it binds different dimensions
                  of salience by representations of higher-order dimensions of
                  salience (just as more abstract object representations bind
                  representations of perceptual features in predictive
                  processing accounts of feature binding). The result of this
                  salience binding is a phenomenally transparent &lquo;salience
                  object&rdquo;, which is represented as a cause of widespread changes
                  in precision estimates, which is a form of epistemic
                  self-control. Phenomenologically, this goes along with the
