summary: "The &ldquo;finding out vs. filling in&rdquo; argument is
Dennett's most subtle argument against the Cartesian Theatre. But rather
than demonstrating that Cartesian thinking is unsalvagable, the fact
that the brain prefers to find out rather than fill simply shows how the
brain implements a (functional) Cartesian Theatre. The brain exploits
the fact that, functionally speaking, finding out is a kind of filling
in."
