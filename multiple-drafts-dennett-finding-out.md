title: "&ldquo;Finding out&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Filling in&rdquo;"
last_updated: August 25, 2015

summary: "The &ldquo;finding out vs. filling in‚Äù argument is perhaps
Dennett's most subtle argument against the Cartesian Theatre. The full
explanation of why his analysis fails underpins the positive account of
the Virtual Cartesian Theatre. Therefore at this point I will just
summarise Dennett's argument and briefly show what it succeeds as an
argument against."
