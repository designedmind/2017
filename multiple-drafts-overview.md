summary: "Dennett's Multiple Drafts theory is primarily a negative
account, focusing on what consciousness could not possibly be. I revisit
Dennett's key arguments, and argue that in each case that the phenomena
in question are not evidence against a coming together, but instead a
glimpse of the clever tricks used to implement a coming together."

[Intro to MD]

In the [last section](multiple-drafts-functional-gateway.html) of this
chapter, I make the case that Dennett's Multiple Drafts model of
consciousness is, in essence, a theory of how such a functional gateway
or inner presentation might work. I shall argue that there is a kind of
"dualism" in how we function, and that taking this aspect of our
behaviour seriously is key to understanding the puzzle of consciousness.

According to [Pessoa et al](#pessoa98),

> Everybody agrees that this idea [the Cartesian Theatre] is totally wrong.

This consensus is problematic, because it hinders progress in a
materialist understanding of consciousness. This is the central
compromise of Consciousness Explained: by steering so clear of anything
Cartesian in flavour, it misses the key opportunity to complete
Dennett's functionalist picture and produce a full account of the "core
features" of phenomenal consciousness, such as qualia and introspection.

Let us first revisit the problem with the Cartesian Theatre as
traditionally construed. It is not simply the threat of infinite regress
(explaining conscious agency requires positing an "inner" conscious
agent, and so on _ad infinitum_). As long as any posited inner agent is
strictly simpler than the agent which contains it, such a regress will
terminate. Indeed, Dennett's theories, and similar positions such as
Lycan's "homuncular functionalism" ([Lycan, 1987]()), propose exactly
such a decomposition of the self into strictly smaller proto-selves.

Rather, the problem with the Cartesian Theatre, at least for Dennett,
seems to be with the idea of a _consciousness gateway_, a special
location through which a perception or other judgement must "pass" -- or
perhaps a special status that it must achieve -- in order for that
perception or judgement to become conscious. But aside from the
obviously Cartesian overtones, why should this idea be problematic? The
thought is perhaps that in a fully materialistic theory, such a
consciousness gateway would be _functionally redundant_. The various
judgements made by the brain need only influence behaviour in the right
way; they do not need to additionally give rise to some kind of inner
presentation.
