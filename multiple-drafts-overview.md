summary: "Dennett's Multiple Drafts theory is primarily a negative
account, focusing on what consciousness could not possibly be. To
understand consciousness properly, we need to recast Dennett's theory as
a positive account. The empirical phenomena Dennett presents as evidence
against a coming together are reinterpreted as a glimpse of the clever
tricks used to implement a coming together."

According to [Pessoa et al](#pessoa98),

> Everybody agrees that this idea [the Cartesian Theatre] is totally wrong.

Methodological consensus is important in science, providing a heuristic
for distinguishing "extraordinary" from ordinary claims and ensuring
that extraordinary claims are supported by extraordinary evidence.
Unfortunately, a widely-held materialist assumption -- that the
Cartesian Theatre is wrong not just in a literal sense but in every
sense -- is a significant stumbling block on the the path towards a
scientific understanding of consciousness. This is ultimately the
problem with [_Consciousness Explained_](#dennett91a), forcing Dennett
to miss the key trick required to complete his otherwise compelling
functionalist picture and produce a full account of the "core features"
of phenomenal consciousness, such as qualia and introspection.

I tend to see the materialist's blanket rejection of the Cartesian
Theatre as an (understandable) overreaction to substance dualism.
Substance dualism -- the belief that the mental constitutes a realm
separate from, but causally linked to, the physical -- is "obviously"
incompatible with the modern scientific image (to most materialists),
and so anything Cartesian in flavour tends to get lumped into the same
bag of bad ideas.

Certainly, Dennett is absolutely clear that his rejection of Cartesian
thinking is broad enough to include even a functional notion of the
Theater:

Exactly what the problem with a functional notion of the Theatre might
actually be, beyond the obvious echoes of substance dualism, is less
clear. There is the familiar spectre of infinite regress. If explaining
conscious agency requires positing an "inner" conscious agent, and so on
_ad infinitum_, then clearly we have a problem. But as long as any
posited inner agent is strictly simpler than the agent which contains
it, infinite regress is avoided. Indeed Dennett's own theories, and
related positions such as Lycan's "homuncular functionalism"
([Lycan, 1987](#lycan87)), propose exactly such a decomposition of the
self into strictly smaller proto-selves.

The real problem with the Cartesian Theatre, at least for Dennett, seems
to be with the idea of a _consciousness gateway_, a special location
through which a perception or other judgement must "pass" -- or perhaps
a special status that it must achieve -- in order for that perception or
judgement to become conscious. The worry is that, in a fully
materialistic theory, such a consciousness gateway would be
_functionally redundant_. The various judgements made by the brain need
only influence behaviour in the right way; they do not need
(functionally speaking) to additionally give rise to some kind of inner
presentation. Any such presentation would be a mysterious "further fact"
about consciousness, related to our behaviour, clearly, but independent
of it in at least one important sense, namely that one could equally
well exhibit the relevant behaviour without the inner presentation.

With this (_prima facia_ reasonable) rejection of Cartesian thinking on
the table from the outset, Dennett devotes much of _Consciousness
Explained_ to purging the vestiges of the Cartesian Theatre from our
fledgling scientific picture of the mind. He enlists a number of
important empirical findings from consciousness research in support of
this project. I consider three of these in detail in the next section:
[spatio-temporal ambiguity](multiple-drafts-dennett-spatio-temporal.html);
the
[susceptibility to future revision](multiple-drafts-dennett-non-monotonic.html)
of narrative content; and that the brain prefers
[finding out to filling in](multiple-drafts-dennett-finding-out.html).
However, although these phenomena do indeed reveal profound things about
consciousness, none of them counts as evidence against an "inner
presentation", as Dennett's materialist commitments lead him to suggest.
On the contrary, they reveal the clever implementation tricks the brain
uses to _implement_ an inner presentation, using nothing but pure
mechanism.

My [conclusion](multiple-drafts-functional-gateway.html) is that we
should invert Dennett's interpretation of his own theory. Multiple
Drafts is not a rejection of a "consciousness gateway" or inner
presentation, but rather the beginnings of a story about how such a
thing _might actually work_. Contra the materialist's intuition, the
notion of inner presentation is not a functionally redundant vestige of
poor Cartesian thinking, but a central functional component of human
perceptual behaviour.
