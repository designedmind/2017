Rejection of the Cartesian Theatre is the hallmark of materialist
thinking about the mind. According to [Pessoa et al](#pessoa98), for
example,

> Everybody agrees that this idea [the Cartesian Theatre] is totally wrong.

One must therefore tread with care when discussing any cognitive
architecture with even a hint of a Cartesian character. This is what I
shall attempt here -- to outline a biologically plausible architecture
for consciousness in which a (functional) Cartesian Theatre plays a
central role in the generation of behaviour. I shall not be proposing an
immaterial basis for consciousness, but rather that there is a kind of
"dualism" in how we function, and that taking this aspect of our
behaviour seriously is key to understanding the puzzle of consciousness.

Let us first revisit the problem with the Cartesian Theatre as
traditionally construed. It is not simply the threat of infinite regress
(explaining conscious agency requires positing an "inner" conscious
agent, and so on _ad infinitum_). As long as any posited inner agent is
strictly simpler than the agent which contains it, such a regress will
terminate. Indeed, Dennett's theories, and similar positions such as
Lycan's "homuncular functionalism" ([Lycan, 1987]()), propose exactly
such a decomposition of the self into strictly smaller proto-selves.

Rather, the problem with the Cartesian Theatre, at least for Dennett,
seems to be with the idea of a _consciousness gateway_, a special
location through which a perception or other judgement must "pass" -- or
perhaps a special status that it must achieve -- in order for that
perception or judgement to become conscious. But aside from the
obviously Cartesian overtones, why should this idea be problematic? The
thought is perhaps that in a fully materialistic theory, such a
consciousness gateway would be _functionally redundant_. The various
judgements made by the brain need only influence behaviour in the right
way; they do not need to additionally give rise to some kind of inner
presentation.

The materialist intuition that a complete theory of consciousness need
only account for behaviour is sound. But what I shall now attempt to
argue is that understanding certain kinds of judgement made by the brain
as constituting an "inner presentation" is not only _compatible_ with
this materialist/functionalist intuition, but in fact _essential_ to
understanding the features of the mind that we most typically associate
with consciousness, such as qualia and introspection.

Moreover, and _contra_ the way Dennett appears to understand his own
theory, Dennett's Multiple Drafts model of consciousness is, in essence,
a theory of how such a functional gateway or inner presentation might
work.
