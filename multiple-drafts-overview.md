summary: "Dennett's Multiple Drafts theory is primarily a negative
account, focusing on what consciousness cannot possibly be. I revisit
three of Dennett's key arguments, in each case arguing that the
phenomenon in question is not evidence against a coming together, but a
glimpse of the clever tricks used to implement a coming together."

According to [Pessoa et al](#pessoa98),

> Everybody agrees that this idea [the Cartesian Theatre] is totally wrong.

Methodological consensus is important in science, allowing us to
distinguish "ordinary" from extraordinary claims and requiring
extraordinary claims to be supported by extraordinary evidence.
Unfortunately, a particular belief held by many materialists -- that the
Cartesian Theatre is totally, irredeemably wrong -- is hindering
progress towards a scientific understanding of consciousness. This
methodological commitment is the central problem with
[_Consciousness Explained_](#dennett91a): by shunning anything remotely
Cartesian in flavour, it misses the key trick required to complete
Dennett's functionalist picture and produce a full account of the "core
features" of phenomenal consciousness, such as qualia and introspection.

The materialist worry about the Cartesian Theatre is understandable.
_Substance_ dualism -- the belief that the mental constitutes a realm
separate from, but causally linked to, the physical -- is essentially
incompatible with the modern scientific image. And to some extent this
renders anything Cartesian in flavour off-limits by association.

There is also the familiar threat of infinite regress. If explaining
conscious agency requires positing an "inner" conscious agent, and so on
_ad infinitum_, then clearly we have a problem. But as long as any
posited inner agent is strictly simpler than the agent which contains
it, infinite regress is avoided. Indeed Dennett's own theories, and
related positions such as Lycan's "homuncular functionalism"
([Lycan, 1987](#lycan87)), propose exactly such a decomposition of the
self into strictly smaller proto-selves.

The real problem with the Cartesian Theatre, at least for Dennett, seems
to be with the idea of a _consciousness gateway_, a special location
through which a perception or other judgement must "pass" -- or perhaps
a special status that it must achieve -- in order for that perception or
judgement to become conscious. The worry is that, in a fully
materialistic theory, such a consciousness gateway would be
_functionally redundant_. The various judgements made by the brain need
only influence behaviour in the right way; they do not need
(functionally speaking) to additionally give rise to some kind of inner
presentation. Any such presentation would be a mysterious "further fact"
about consciousness, related to our behaviour, clearly, but independent
of it in at least one important sense, namely that one could equally
well exhibit the relevant behaviour without the inner presentation.

With this (_prima facia_ reasonable) rejection of Cartesian thinking on
the table from the outset, Dennett devotes much of _Consciousness
Explained_ to purging the vestiges of the Cartesian Theatre from our
fledgling scientific picture of the mind. He enlists a number of
important empirical findings from consciousness research in support of
this project. I consider three of these in detail in the next section:
[spatio-temporal ambiguity](multiple-drafts-dennett-spatio-temporal.html);
the
[susceptibility to future revision](multiple-drafts-dennett-non-monotonic.html)
of narrative content; and that the brain prefers
[finding out to filling in](multiple-drafts-dennett-finding-out.html).
However, although these phenomena do indeed reveal profound things about
consciousness, none of them counts as evidence against an "inner
presentation", as Dennett's materialist commitments lead him to suggest.
On the contrary, they reveal the clever implementation tricks the brain
uses to _implement_ an inner presentation, using nothing but pure
mechanism.

My [conclusion](multiple-drafts-functional-gateway.html) is that we
should invert Dennett's interpretation of his own theory. Multiple
Drafts is not a rejection of a "consciousness gateway" or inner
presentation, but rather the beginnings of a story about how such a
thing _might actually work_. Contra the materialist's intuition, the
notion of inner presentation is not a functionally redundant vestige of
poor Cartesian thinking, but a central functional component of human
perceptual behaviour.
