summary: "Dennett's Multiple Drafts theory is primarily a negative
account, focusing on what consciousness could not possibly be. I revisit
Dennett's key arguments, and argue that in each case that the phenomena
in question are not evidence against a coming together, but instead a
glimpse of the clever tricks used to implement a coming together."

According to [Pessoa et al](#pessoa98),

This methodological consensus is problematic, because it hinders
progress towards a materialist understanding of consciousness. This is
the central problem with _Consciousness Explained_: by being so
resistant to anything Cartesian in flavour, it misses a key opportunity
to complete Dennett's functionalist picture and produce a full account
of the "core features" of phenomenal consciousness, such as qualia and
introspection.

Let us first revisit the problem with the Cartesian Theatre as
traditionally construed. It is not simply the threat of infinite regress
(explaining conscious agency requires positing an "inner" conscious
agent, and so on _ad infinitum_). As long as any posited inner agent is
strictly simpler than the agent which contains it, such a regress will
terminate. Indeed, Dennett's theories, and similar positions such as
Lycan's "homuncular functionalism" ([Lycan, 1987]()), propose exactly
such a decomposition of the self into strictly smaller proto-selves.

Rather, the problem with the Cartesian Theatre, at least for Dennett,
seems to be with the idea of a _consciousness gateway_, a special
location through which a perception or other judgement must "pass" -- or
perhaps a special status that it must achieve -- in order for that
perception or judgement to become conscious. But aside from the
obviously Cartesian overtones, why should this idea be problematic? The
thought is perhaps that in a fully materialistic theory, such a
consciousness gateway would be _functionally redundant_. The various
judgements made by the brain need only influence behaviour in the right
way; they do not need to additionally give rise to some kind of inner
presentation.

In the next section, I review three empirical features of consciousness
offered by Dennett to reject any vestige of the Cartesian Theatre:
spatio-temporal ambiguity; susceptibility to future revision; and that
the brain prefers
[&lsquo;finding out&rsquo; to &lsquo;filling in&rsquo;](multiple-drafts-dennett-finding-out.html).
While these are all important facts about consciousness, none of them
count as evidence against a functional counterpart of the Cartesian
Theatre. On the contrary, they reveal the clever implementation tricks
required to implement precisely such an abstraction.

In the [last section](multiple-drafts-functional-gateway.html) of this
chapter, I make the case that Dennett's Multiple Drafts model of
consciousness is, in essence, a theory of how such a functional gateway
or inner presentation might work. I shall argue that there is a
"dualism" in how we function, that is to say a kind of inner
presentation which is _not_ functionally redundant, but which has an
important functional role to play. Acknowledging the existence of this
aspect of our behaviour is key to understanding the puzzle of
consciousness.
