summary: "Dennett's Multiple Drafts theory is primarily a negative
account, focusing on what consciousness could not possibly be. I revisit
three of Dennett's key arguments. In each case, I argue that the
phenomenon in question is not evidence against a coming together, but a
glimpse of the clever tricks used to implement a coming together."

This methodological consensus is problematic, because it hinders
progress towards a materialist understanding of consciousness. Indeed,
it is the central problem with [_Consciousness Explained_](#dennett91a);
by shunning anything remotely Cartesian in flavour, it misses the key
trick required to complete Dennett's functionalist picture and produce a
full account of the "core features" of phenomenal consciousness, such as
qualia and introspection.

So what exactly is the materialist's problem with the Cartesian Theatre?
As I discussed in the [introduction](introduction.html), substance
dualism is uncontroversially false, and to some extent anything which
_feels_ like dualism gets tarred with the same brush. There is the
familiar threat of infinite regress (if explaining conscious agency
requires positing an "inner" conscious agent, and so on _ad infinitum_,
then we have a problem). But as long as any posited inner agent is
strictly simpler than the agent which contains it, infinite regress is
avoided. Indeed Dennett's own theories, and related positions such as
Lycan's "homuncular functionalism" ([Lycan, 1987](#lycan87)), propose
exactly such a decomposition of the self into strictly smaller
proto-selves.

Rather, the problem with the Cartesian Theatre, at least for Dennett,
seems to be with the idea of a _consciousness gateway_, a special
location through which a perception or other judgement must "pass" -- or
perhaps a special status that it must achieve -- in order for that
perception or judgement to become conscious. The worry here is that, in
a fully materialistic theory, such a consciousness gateway would be
_functionally redundant_. The various judgements made by the brain need
only influence behaviour in the right way; they do not need
(functionally speaking) to additionally give rise to some kind of inner
presentation. Any such presentation would be a mysterious "further fact"
about consciousness, related to our behaviour, clearly, but independent
of it in at least one important sense, namely that one could equally
well exhibit the relevant behaviour without the inner presentation.

With this (_prima facia_ reasonable) rejection of Cartesian thinking on
the table from the outset, Dennett devotes much of _Consciousness
Explained_ attempting to purge the vestiges of the Cartesian Theatre
from our fledgling scientific picture of the mind. He enlists a number
of important empirical findings from consciousness research in support
of this project. In the next section I consider three of these in
detail:
[spatio-temporal ambiguity](multiple-drafts-dennett-spatio-temporal.html);
the
[susceptibility to future revision](multiple-drafts-dennett-non-monotonic.html)
of narrative content; and that the brain prefers
[&lsquo;finding out&rsquo; to &lsquo;filling in&rsquo;](multiple-drafts-dennett-finding-out.html).
In each case, I will argue that although the phenomena in question does
indeed reveal something profound about consciousness, it does not count
as evidence against an "inner presentation", as Dennett's materialist
commitments lead him to suggest. On the contrary, these phenomena reveal
the clever implementation tricks the brain uses to _implement_ an inner
presentation, using nothing but pure mechanism.

In the [last section](multiple-drafts-functional-gateway.html) of this
chapter, I summarise this critique of Dennett's position. I argue that
we should invert Dennett's interpretation of his own Multiple Drafts
theory, and see it as an account of how a functional "consciousness
gateway" or inner presentation _might actually work_. Contra the
materialist's intuition, the notion of inner presentation is not a
functionally redundant vestige of poor Cartesian thinking, but a central
functional component of human perceptual behaviour. Acknowledging the
existence of this aspect of our behaviour is the key step required to
demystify consciousness.
