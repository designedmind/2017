                <h2>DESIGNED MIND 2024</h2>
                <p>How does subjective experience evolve and what new capabilities does it enable? How easy will it be (by design or by accident) to build conscious machines?</p>

                <p>Modern scientific theories of consciousness (proposed by the likes of Dennett, Meztinger and Graziano) construe subjectivity as a particularly rich form of self-simulation. While self-control may always involve some form of self-representation, conscious systems seem to take this further: by representing itself as a <i>situated agent</i> with all kinds of opportunity for action, both overt and covert, as its disposal, this self-simulation or self-model permits new levels of autonomy, self-monitoring and deliberation. On this view subjectivity evolves hand-in-hand with the kind of deliberative, hyper-plastic behaviour typical of humans.</p>

                <p>This emerging understanding of consciousness as key to unlocking powerful new capabilities is now seeing practical application in the next generation of generative AI. Although recent advances have been impressive, current systems still fall far short of human-style reasoning, and some researchers are looking to theories of subjectivity as inspiration for new machine architectures. If our theories of consciousness are right then the prospect of building a machine that attributes to itself a rich inner mental life, as humans do, is becoming a plausible reality. While the ethical and societal implications of doing so are vast, its scientific and philosophical significance is also not to be underestimated.</p>

                <p>This two-day symposium will bring together cognitive scientists, philosophers, computer scientists, roboticists, neuroscientists and biologists interested in the science, evolution and engineering of subjectivity and deliberative action.</p>

                <h3>Possible topics</h3>

                <p>We invite contributions with a close fit to the themes of the symposium. The following list of topics is not intended to be exhaustive.</p>

                <h4>Active inference</h4>

                <h4>Metacognition</h4>

                <h4>Covert action and mental affordances</h4>

                <p>How much of our subjective lives can be understood in terms of covert action? Can pain and other first-person "feelings" be understood in terms of affordances for self-attribution? What are the consequences of these actions, if they are covert â€“ perhaps the ability to influence downstream overt action? Is covertness key to understanding our intuition that consciousness is profoundly "private"? Will intelligent machines try to convince us of a Hard Problem?</p>

                <h4>Behavioural flexibility and free will</h4>

                <p>What kinds of behaviours require subjectivity? To what extent can "free will" &#8212; understood as a form of deliberative, considered action with the potential for explicitly represented aspiration and regret &#8212; be separated from subjective experience?</p>

                <h4>Niche construction and the evolution of subjectivity</h4>

                <p>What were the key moments in hominin evolution that drove the development of subjectivity and deliberative action? How essential was language to the niche?</p>

                <h4>Animal consciousness</h4>
                All living organisms exhibit flexible goal-directed behaviour.

                <h4>Control theory and cybernetics</h4>
