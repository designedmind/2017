## Designed Mind 2024

### Topics

We invite contributions from a wide variety of fields (cognitive science, philosophy, neuroscience, AI, robotics and evolutionary biology) with a close fit to the themes of the symposium.

#### Active inference

#### Metacognition

#### Covert action and mental affordances

How much of our subjective lives can be understood in terms of covert action? Can pain and other first-person "feelings" be understood in terms of affordances for self-attribution? What are the consequences of these actions, if they are covert – perhaps the ability to influence downstream overt action? Is covertness key to understanding our intuition that consciousness is profoundly "private"? Will intelligent machines try to convince us of a Hard Problem?

#### Behavioural flexibility and free will

What kinds of behaviours require subjectivity? To what extent can "free will" – understood as a form of deliberative, considered action with the potential for regret – be separated from subjective experience?

#### Niche construction and the evolution of subjectivity

What was the cognitive/social niche that drove the evolution of subjectivity and deliberative action? How essential was language to that niche?

#### Animal consciousness

#### Control theory and cybernetics

### Notes/Questions

- Don’t even bother engaging with the non-functional/Hard Problem POV. There‘s a lot to say already and this will just get in the way. Similarly, I’ve avoided the term "consciousness" as much as possible and talked instead of "subjectivity" (and "deliberative action" over "free will").

- Are we looking for "position papers" or research contributions or both? (I think perhaps both. Perhaps we could invite position papers – here I’m thinking of something like Steve Fleming on metacognition.)

- I like the idea of proposing explicit questions (as long as it‘s clear it’s not intended as an exhaustive list)
