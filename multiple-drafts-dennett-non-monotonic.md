summary: "Colour phi shows how the brain revises the self-narrative to
maximise local consistency. Dennett concludes that there is no such
thing as a finish line in the brain beyond which a percept is conscious.
An interpretation more consistent with functionalism is to see narrative
revision as a strategy for implementing a virtual finish line, a
dynamically maintained interpretation of reality whose functional role
is to determine the content of our phenomenal world."

So it would seem that
[spatio-temporal smearing](multiple-drafts-dennett-spatio-temporal.html)
presents no particular problem for the (functional) Cartesian Theatre.
Dennett's next attempt to eliminate the Theatre is based on another
revealing empirical phenomenon, the susceptibility of conscious content
to _revision_ in the light of further input or processing. Dennett does
a brilliant job of deconstructing the apparent oddity of these temporal
tricks, showing how they can be made sense of by understanding
consciousness as an _ex post facto_ interpretation of reality, rather
than a real-time "phenomenal correlate" of perceptual processing.

The empirical component of Dennett's argument draws mainly on the
so-called
[colour phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_phi_phenomenon) effect.
The phi phenomenon is the illusion of apparent motion, familiar as the
basis for film and television, caused by viewing a series of still
images in rapid succession. Consider a small spot of light flashed on a
screen, and then displayed again at a position translated slightly to
the right, and so on at frequent intervals. If the time interval is
small enough, the subject perceives the smooth movement of a single spot
of light, rather than distinct flashes.

Colour phi is a variant of the phi effect, and was first studied in
response to a question posed by Nelson Goodman ([1978](#goodman78)).
Goodman asked how changing the colour of the successive spots of light
in the middle of the animation would impact the associated visual
phenomenonology. Specifically, Goodman wondered how the apparent
continuity of the movement would affect the perceived _spatio-temporal
locus_ of the change.

Consider the figure on the left below, which shows the transition
between the green spots and the blue spots. (The last green spot and the
first blue spot are shown.) Given that the subject reports seeing a
continuously moving spot, when does the colour change seem to occur?

| Shown         | Reported      |
|--------------:|--------------:|
| ![Wibble](/images/color-phi-1.jpg) | ![Wibble](/images/color-phi-2.jpg) |

The diagram on the right above shows how the colour-change appears: the
spot seems to change colour mid-trajectory, at a spatio-temporal
location roughly halfway between the last green spot and the first blue
spot ([Kolers and von Grünau, 1976](#kolers76)). In a sense this is
unsurprising, since it is consistent with the apparently continuous
motion of the spot; but at the same time it seems rather odd, since the
switch to blue has _not yet occurred_ at the point in time at which –
according to your subsequent verbal reports – you _experienced_ the
switch to blue.

Dennett does an excellent job of demystifying this apparent oddity. To
do so, he deploys a crucial (and typically Dennettian) distinction: that
between the temporal _content_ of a representation, and the temporal
properties of the representation itself. The key insight is that a
judgement made by the brain can be antedated: its content given a
earlier “postmark” which retroactively fits it into an unfolding account
of what happened in such a way that the story being told is consistent
with the total stimulus received thus far. More succinctly, a judgement
made at time _t_ can be "about" how the world seemed at some _earlier_
time _t'_. Since, by Dennett's reckoning, this unfolding narrative is
constitutive of the content of our consciousness, the effect observed
through behavioural studies is that I appear to become conscious of the
colour switch before the colour switch actually occurs. There is nothing
paradoxical about this:

> “no sounds appear to issue from heads before lips move, nor do hands
> move before the brain events that purportedly cause them”
> ([Dennett and Kinsbourne, 1992](#dennett92)).

Only when comparing the subject's reported stream of consciousness to
the timing of external events do we find a putative anomaly, and
Dennett's account of the narrative-building process explains these data
quite comfortably. (For further discussion, see
[Dennett, 1991a](#dennett91a) and [Dennett, 1995](#dennett95).)

A useful short-hand for this susceptibility to future revision is
_non-monotonicity_. A system of reasoning is _monotonic_ if additional
data can never cause the retraction of any conclusions made thus far;
consciousness is not monotonic, in that the acquisition of new
information can force a change in inferences already made. Dennett's
explanation of the colour phi in terms of non-monotonic narrative
construction and revision is a genuine breakthrough in the understanding
of consciousness. However, he sees his narrative-building story as an
account of the phenomena that side-steps any notion of inner
presentation, even one purely functional in nature.

The line roughly runs: since the brain can change its mind about what
seemed to happen, there is simply no fact of the matter about what
seemed to happen. “There is no finish line”, as Dennett puts it
([1995](#dennett95)). Unfortunately although non-monotonicity
successfully dispenses with the notion of a canonical or objective
finish line which is the ultimate authority on our conscious experience,
it does not in any way preclude the possibility of something which
behaviourally amounts to an “official” finish line, just one that is
subject to occasional revision. Indeed, and perhaps ironically,
Dennett's Multiple Drafts Model in general, and his account of colour
phi in particular, amount to a theory of how just such a behavioural
finish line might actually come about. It is all very well to talk of
the efforts the brain goes to to pre-date various judgements in the
colour phi experiments, but this immediately raises the question of why
the brain even bothers to do this antedating. The natural explanation is
that it does so in order to maximise the local integrity of the
narrative precisely so that there is, at any point in time, a single
official picture of “how it was to be me” at some earlier time. These
kinds of editing efforts by the brain should therefore be interpreted as
constructors of a virtual finish line, a functional, behavioural one,
rather than a physical one. So where Dennett-the-anti-Cartesian wants to
conclude, from non-monotonicity, that there is no fact of the matter as
to how it was to be me (at t), Dennett-the-functionalist's reply would
be to say that at any subsequent time t', there are indeed facts of the
matter as to how it was to be me at t, and those facts are solely
determined by the t-related content of the narrative at t'; it just so
happens that at some other subsequent time t'', there may be a different
facts of the matter about how it was to be me at t.

This susceptibility to revision is hardly unique to mental events, after
all. In formal systems, monotonicity is a often a desirable
characteristic, but in the real world – the world of practising
scientists as well as the world of everyday folk-theorising –
non-monotonicity is common. Systems which have some dynamical component,
such as eco-systems, economies, materials under stress, and human brains
are often interpreted non-monotonically because they often have a high
degree of sensitivity to initial conditions which means it is hard to
predict how the system will evolve. “What happened at time t” in such
systems is not necessarily a fixed fact but one which is subject to
change should the subsequent evolution of the system suggest
reinterpretation of an earlier model of its history.

As we did with the spatiotemporal ambiguity case, let's follow Dennett's
line of reasoning in a less contentious context, as a kind of intuition
counter-pump. Consider speciation events in an ecological system. Now,
the precise definition of species is an elusive one in biology but
mainly for reasons which need not concern us here; what do concern us
here are the epistemic limits that prevent us from observing a
speciation event as it occurs. If two populations within a single
species become reproductively isolated for some reason (say geographical
separation), we cannot be certain that we have observed a new species in
the making, not just because a species is composed of multiple
individuals and therefore its creation is spatio-temporally distributed,
but because a speciation event is only a speciation event because of
some property of how the system subsequently evolves. If the two
populations subsequently merge and continue interbreeding as before then
we will not be inclined to say that we saw a speciation event take place
followed immediately by an unspeciation event, but simply that no such
event took place in the first place. On the other hand if we study the
populations for some time and eventually they lose reproductive
affinity, or they reproduce but produce sterile offspring, or some other
criterion is met which is considered sufficient for the existence of a
separate species, then we could quite reasonably go back and
retrospectively identify the original reproductive isolation as the
beginning of a temporally extended speciation event. If Dennett were to
pursue his own line of reasoning here, he would be forced to conclude
from the absence of irrevocable, perspective-independent facts about
whether speciation events have occurred, to the absence of speciation
events altogether. This is presumably a stronger conclusion than Dennett
would want to draw here.

One of our goals here was to understand what Dennett's arguments succeed
at too. As with the
[spatio-temporal ambiguity argument](multiple-drafts-dennett-spatio-temporal),
non-monotonicity shows that conscious events simply cannot evolve in
lock-step with brain events, since that would involve mental events
being able to travel backwards in time or other such esoterica. This is
perhaps the most important conclusion we should draw from the multiple
drafts story: that there is no "irrefutable" narrative which is
canonical – that represents the "actual" stream of consciousness of the
subject. To put it another way, consciousness cannot at the level of
micro-structure be the literal "leading edge of perceptual memory"
([Lockwood, 1993](#lockwood93)) but must be a just-after-the-fact
interpretation of what has happened thus far, an interpretation that is
not immune to revision in the light of further evidence.

So what does Dennett's deep insight about narrative revision _actually_
reveal, if it in fact supports, rather than refutes, a functional
version of the Cartesian Theatre? One thing it shows is that the content
of phenomenonal consciousness cannot be a direct _correlate_ (in the
sense of being in spatio-temporal lock-step with) the neural processing
associated directly with perception (cf. Teller and Pugh, 1983). Such
correspondence, if it exists, must be more topological or functional
than topographical or spatial. This is an important lesson to come away
with, given just how deep the “direct correspondence” intuition runs
among scientists (see Chalmers, 1998, for a comprehensive list of some
of “neural correlate” stories which have been told so far), but ipso
facto has no relevance to the heterophenomenological case for the
Virtual Cartesian Theatre.
