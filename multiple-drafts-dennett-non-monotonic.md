summary: "Colour phi shows how the brain revises the self-narrative to
maximise local consistency. Dennett concludes that there is no such
thing as a finish line in the brain beyond which a percept is conscious.
An interpretation more consistent with functionalism is to see narrative
revision as a strategy for implementing a virtual finish line, a
dynamically maintained interpretation of reality whose functional role
is to determine the content of our phenomenal world."

Dennett's next attempt to eliminate the Theatre is based on another
revealing empirical phenomenon: the susceptibility of conscious content
to _revision_ in the light of further input or processing. Dennett does
a brilliant job of deconstructing these apparent temporal oddities,
showing how they can be made sense of by understanding consciousness as
an _ex post facto_ interpretation of reality, rather than a real-time
"phenomenal correlate" of perceptual processing. Less convincingly, he
tries to present this view of consciousness as evidence against anything
resembling an inner presentation. On closer scrutiny a functional inner
presentation is exactly what his theory explains.

The empirical phenomenon of interest is the so-called
[colour phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_phi_phenomenon) effect.
The phi phenomenon is the illusion of apparent motion, familiar as the
basis of film and television, that arises when we view a series of still
images in rapid succession. Consider a small spot of light flashed on a
screen, and then displayed again at a position translated slightly to
the right, and so on at frequent intervals. If the time interval is
small enough, the subject perceives the smooth movement of a single spot
of light, rather than distinct flashes.

Colour phi is a variant of the phi effect, first studied in response to
a question posed by Nelson Goodman ([1978](#goodman78)). Goodman asked
how changing the colour of the successive spots of light in the middle
of the sequence would impact the associated visual phenomenonology.
Specifically, Goodman wondered how the fact that subjects report seeing
a continuously moving spot would affect the perceived spatio-temporal
locus of the change.

The figure on the left below depicts the transition between the two
colours as it actually happens, showing the last green spot and the
first blue spot in the sequence. The figure on the right shows how the
change is reported by the subject after the whole sequence has been
displayed. The spot seems to change colour mid-trajectory, at a
spatio-temporal location roughly halfway between the last green spot and
the first blue spot ([Kolers and von Grünau, 1976](#kolers76)).

| Shown         | Reported      |
|--------------:|--------------:|

The apparent locus of the change is consistent with the interpolative
nature of the apparent motion, and so is in a sense unsurprising. On the
other hand, the switch to blue has _not yet occurred_ at the point in
time at which – according to their subsequent verbal reports – the
subject _experience_ the switch to blue. So there does seem to be
something about our subjective experience that needs to be explained
here: our consciousness appears to anticipate the change in colour
before it occurs!

Dennett does an excellent job of demystifying this apparent oddity. His
explanation makes use of an insightful, and typically Dennettian,
distinction: the contrast between the temporal _content_ of a
representation, and the temporal properties of the representation.
itself. The key insight is that a judgement made by the brain can be
_antedated_: its content given a earlier “postmark” which retroactively
splices it into an unfolding account of what happened. If new data
arrive which contradict an earlier working hypothesis ("there is a green
spot moving southeast"), the brain's interpretation of past events can
be updated into a new best fit for the total stimulus received thus far.
In this case, the problematic datum is the arrival of the first blue
spot. Given that the new datum is consistent with the inference that
there is a moving spot, a reasonable hypothesis is that the spot changes
colour at its inferred location in "interpolation space".

By the time I am asked to describe what I saw, the record of "what I
saw" has already been patched with the new interpretation, so that as
far as I am concerned, I became conscious of the colour switch before
the colour switch actually occurred. But there is no paradox:

> “no sounds appear to issue from heads before lips move, nor do hands
> move before the brain events that purportedly cause them”
> ([Dennett and Kinsbourne, 1992](#dennett92)).

Only when comparing "virtual time", in the subject's reported stream of
consciousness, to "actual time", as determined by external events, do we
find a putative anomaly, and Dennett's _ex post facto_ narrative-editing
account explains these data elegantly. (For further discussion, see
[Dennett, 1991](#dennett91a) and [Dennett, 1995](#dennett95).)

Thus, a perceptual judgement made at time _t_ can be "about" how the
world seemed at some _earlier_ time _t'_, and overwrite an earlier
judgement made about time _t'_. A useful technical term here is
_monotonicity_; a system of reasoning is monotonic only if additional
data can never cause the retraction of earlier conclusions. Perceptual
inference is non-monotonic, in that the acquisition of new information
can force a change in inferences already made.

Dennett's explanation of colour phi in terms of non-monotonic narrative
construction and revision is a profound insight into visual
phenomenonology. Dennett's even more radical idea is that this unfolding
narrative is _constitutive of_ the content of our consciousness, that
there is nothing more to phenomenonal consciousness than
more-or-less-retroactively constructed judgements about the way the
world is. The reason that Dennett's account hasn't been more widely
accepted is, I think, due to his insistence that this radical theory
_eliminates_, rather than _explains_, any notion of inner presentation.
His argument roughly runs: since the brain can change its mind about
what seemed to happen, there is simply no fact of the matter about what
seemed to happen. “There is no finish line”, as Dennett puts it
([1995](#dennett95)).

This is too quick, and inconsistent with the functionalism to which
Dennett is otherwise committed. Non-monotonicity certainly shows us that
there is no final word on the content of conscious experience, and that
what we are conscious of is _a story told after the fact_ that best fits
the available data, one which may be revised later. But this is not to
say that there is no finish line, but rather to explain how the finish
line works.

Dennett reveals the effort the brain goes to to antedate various
judgements in the colour phi experiments. But why does the brain bother
to patch its interpretation of past events? Presumably, _precisely_ so
that there is, at any point in time, an official story of “how it was to
be me” at some earlier time, albeit a transient one that may be revised
again in the future. These editing efforts by the brain should be
interpreted as _constructors of a virtual finish line_, a functional,
behavioural one, rather than a physical one, but a finish line
nonetheless.

Dennett's deep insight about consciousness-as-narrative turns out to
support, rather than refute, the functional Cartesian Theatre. What does
it tell us about consciousness, if not exactly what Dennett thinks it
does? One thing it shows is that the content of phenomenonal
consciousness cannot be a direct _correlate_ (in the sense of being in
spatio-temporal lock-step with) the neural processing associated
directly with perception (cf. [Teller and Pugh, 1983](#teller83)). The
"neural correlate" intuition about consciousness often goes like this:
for every perceptual judgement, there is (simultaneously, but
mysteriously) a corresponding conscious "judgement", and moreover these
two kinds of judgement are in a one-to-one, real-time correspondence.
(See [Chalmers, 1998](chalmers98), for a comprehensive list of some of
of the neural correlate stories which have been told so far.) The neural
correlate intuition (at least in this naive form) and the "further fact"
intuition (a.k.a. the zombie hunch) go hand-in-hand: construed this way,
phenomenonology has no functional role to play, since it is just
"inwardly observed" perception.

What Dennett shows us is that _phenomenology is functionality_; it is a
particular way of organising perceptual judgements into a narrative that
itself has a central role to play in the generation of behaviour. I
expand on this substantially at
[the end of this chapter](multiple-drafts-functional-gateway),
considering many familiar examples of human behaviour where an inner
presentation is the key functional abstraction at work.
