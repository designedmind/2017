The Designed Mind is my attempt to explain consciousness -- in all its
first-person, qualia-infected, phenomenal glory -- as an evolved feature
of human _behaviour_. I will try to say what conscious is, what it does,
and why it evolved. My main source of inspiration will be Dennett's
multiple-drafts model, but I push it further than Dennett, arguing that
the multiple-drafts model is in essence an account of a "virtual"
Cartesian theatre, where all our phenomenal life takes place.

Many people feel strongly that an account of consciousness that
considers only behaviour and function ignores the key mystery, namely
how matter manages to acquire a first-person point of view. I used to
share that intuition, but I've since learned to think of consciousness
as a _very particular kind_ of behaviour, one driven by a rich internal
narrative constructed by our brains precisely so that we can exhibit
that particular kind of behaviour. The narrative has as its subject
matter our phenomenal world.

When we insist that we are inside our skulls, looking out, it is the
content of the self-narrative that drives that behaviour of insisting.
There is no _further fact_, that we _really are_ (in some other sense)
inside our skulls, looking out.
