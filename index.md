The Designed Mind is my attempt to understand consciousness — in all its
first-person, qualia-infected, phenomenal glory — as an evolved feature
of human behaviour. I think Sutherland was wrong: it indeed possible to
say what conscious is, what it does, and why it evolved. My account is
based on Dennett's so called
[multiple drafts](multiple-drafts-overview.html) model, but with a
twist. Rather than seeing Dennett's theory as an _alternative to_ a
naive Cartesian view of the mind, I will argue that the best way to see
the multiple drafts model is as an _account of_ a Cartesian theatre — a
"virtual" Cartesian theatre, implemented in wetware — in which all our
phenomenal life takes place.

Many people feel strongly that an account of consciousness that
considers only behaviour and function ignores the key mystery, namely
how matter manages to acquire a first-person point of view. I used to
share that intuition, but I've since learned to think of (phenomenal)
consciousness as a _very particular kind_ of behaviour, one driven by a
rich internal narrative constructed by our brains. The narrative has as
its subject matter our phenomenal world.

When we insist that we are inside our skulls, looking out, it is the
content of the self-narrative that drives that behaviour of insisting.
There is no _further fact_, that we _really are_ (in some other sense)
inside our skulls, looking out.
